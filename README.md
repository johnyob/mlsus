> A sus-piciously simple ML featuring constraint-based type inference with suspended constraints -- no impostors here!

`mlsus` is a work-in-progress specification and implementation of a constraint-based type checker for an ML language with constructor and record overloading. It introduces a novel approach by utilising *suspended constraints* to achieve this functionality.

## Getting Started

> [!NOTE]
> `mlsus` is built with Nix, a package manager and system configuration tool that makes building from sources easy! See the [Nix docs](https://nixos.org/download/) for instructions for your system. Additionally, ensure [Nix flakes are enabled](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes#Enable_flakes).


To build `mlsus` from source, follow these steps:
```sh
# Clone the repository
‚ùØ git clone https://github.com/johnyob/mlsus.git && cd mlsus
# Enter the Nix development environment
‚ùØ nix develop
# Build üöÄ
‚ùØ make
```

We strongly recommend using Nix. Nevertheless, `mlsus` can be built using `opam` and `dune` directly. 
Proceed by creating a fresh opam switch by running the following:
```sh
# Clone the repository
‚ùØ git clone https://github.com/johnyob/mlsus.git && cd mlsus
# Create switch üéõÔ∏è
‚ùØ opam switch create . --no-install
‚ùØ eval $(opam config env)
# Install dependencies üì¶
‚ùØ opam install -y --deps-only --with-test --with-doc .
# Build üöÄ
‚ùØ make
```

## Quick Start

To get started with type checking some examples, run the command below:
```sh
‚ùØ dune exec mlsus -- type-check examples/test.ml
```

## Commands

For an overview of commands, run:
```
‚ùØ dune exec mlsus -- help
mlsus                                 

  mlsus SUBCOMMAND

=== subcommands ===

  constraint-gen             . Parses [filename] and prints the generated
                               constraint (formatted as a sexp).
  lex                        . Lexes [filename] and prints the tokens.
  parse                      . Parses [filename] and prints the program
                               (formatted as a sexp).
  type-check                 . Type checks [filename].
  version                    . print version information
  help                       . explain a given subcommand (perhaps recursively)
```

## Building the Specification

To build the `mlsus` specification from source using Nix, follow 
these steps:
```sh
‚ùØ nix develop
‚ùØ make -C report
```

We strongly recommend using Nix. Nevertheless, the `mlsus` report can be built using `typst` directly. 
See the [Typst docs](https://github.com/typst/typst?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) for instructions 
for your system. After installing `typst`, simply run:
```sh
‚ùØ make -C report
``` 

### Contributing to the Specification

> [!TIP]
> Use [Tinymist](https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist), an integrated language server for Typst. See the [Tinymist Docs](https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) for instructions for your editor.

To get started with writing / modifying the `mlsus` specification, run the command below:
```sh
‚ùØ make -C report watch
```
