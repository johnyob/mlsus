\title{Omnidirectional type inference:
   principality revisited \\ for advanced \ML extensions
}

\begin{document}

\begin{abstract}
We propose a new concept of \emph{omnidirectional} type inference, which is
the ability to resolve \ML-style typing constraints in disorder, by
contrast with all known implementations that always typecheck the
bindings before the bodies of let-expressions.
%
This relies on two technical devices: \emph{partial type schemes}
and \emph{suspended match constraints}. Partial here means  the
possibility of taking an instances of a type scheme that is not yet
completely solved with a mechanism to tack and update their instances when
the type scheme is refined, incrementally.
\emph{Suspended} match constraints means a mechanism to delay the resolution of
some constraints which typically require non-local not-yet-available
contextual information and to be discharged then when we have learned enough
information from the resolution of other constraints, typically when some type
variables have been instantiated.
%
We illustrate the benefit of omnidirectional type inference for several
advanced features present in the \OCaml language, including static
overloading of record labels and datatype constructors on the one hand and
semi-explicit polymorphism on the other hand.

\section{Introduction}

ML polymorphism, also known as Hindley-Milner type system, has been a very
sweet spot in the design space of strongly typed programming languages, as
it enjoys the principal type property and, more importantly, is closed by
common program transformations such as let-contraction and let-expansion,
and permutation of the order or arguments.

Over the years, many extensions of \ML have been proposed. Some of the new
constructs, such as extensible records with row-polymorphism, higher-kinded
types, or dimensional types, fit perfectly into the \ML framework. Others
such as GADTs, semi-explicit polymorphism, first-class modules or static
overloading of datatype constructors and record fields, are
\emph{fragile}, as they sometimes require explicit type
annotations.
In order to minimize the need for type anotations, their specifications have
been twisted with some direct or indirect algorithmic flavor in order to
preserve \emph{principality}.
%
These (more or less ad-hoc) restrictions in the specification are designed
especially to reject examples that would break completeness with respect to
the type-checker implementations, but they also simultaneously reject other
examples whose type could easily be guessed.\Xgabriel{I would like to
explain more here, it is not obvious why completeness-breaking examples also
endanger principality.}  Unsurprisingly, they have historically posed
challenges to the preservation of principal types.

Optional type annotations may sometimes but not always be omitted: the
return type of overload data constructors can be annotated; polymorphic
expressions can be annotated with a type scheme; first-class module
expressions with a module signature; for GADTs, the type of the
\texttt{match} scrutinee can be annotated to a rigid type which will be
refined by type equalities in each branch. To each fragile construct
corresponds a robust construct where this type annotation is mandatory. The
robust constructs fit perfectly into the \ML framework, but are
significantly more cumbersome to use, as they always require explicit type
annotations.  Fragile constructs can be defined by elaboration into their
robust counterpart. The elaboration determines which annotations can be
omitted and rebuilt from context, a point of view already taken by~\citet
{Pottier-Regis-Gianas/stratified@popl06} in their work on stratified type
inference.
%
The difficulty of fragile constructs lies in finding a specification
that is sufficiently expressive, principled, intuitive for the user,
and for which we have a complete and effective elaboration algorithm.

The solutions proposed so far all enforce some ordering in which type
inference is performed, which can then be used to propagate both inferred
types and user-provided type annotations as \emph{known} types that can be
used for disambiguation and enable the omission of some annotations.

\paragraph{Bidirectional type inference}

Bidirectional type inference is a known alternative to unification for
propagating type information. It can be presented by adding to the type
inference algorithm an optional expected type in addition to the expression
to be typechecked and the context in which it should be typechecked.  Type
inference is said in \emph{checking mode} when the expected type is present,
and in (the usual) \emph{inference mode} when it is absent. The checking
mode allows to pass source type annotations but also previously inferred
types such as the codomain of a function in an application position during
type inference of the arguments.
%
Bidirectional type inference is actually a framework that must be
instantiated by a particular choice of modes for each of the language
construct, while there is no optimal combination of modes for the whole set
of language constructs. Once modes have been fixed, there are usually
principal solutions to the type inference problem, but with respect to a
specification that made non-principal choices.
%
Bidirectional type inference has been largely used for languages with
higher-rank polymorphism or subtyping~\TODO{citations}. Still, both \OCaml
and \Haskell only use a limited form of bidirectional type inference to
limit its downsides.


\paragraph{\Geninst-directional type inference}

 \Xdidier {See other choices in \texttt{./abbreviations.sty}}
\OCaml uses another mechanism for propagation of type information,
based on polymorphism, which actually enforces an ordering in the
typechecking of let-bindings, where the (polymorphic part of) a the
bound expression must be typed before the body of the let-expression.
We call it \textbf{\geninst}-directional type inference, to mean that
polymorphic expressions must be typed before their
instances.  Initially introduced with the extension of \ML with
semi-explicit first-class polymorphism~\cite {Garrigue-Remy/poly-ml},
it has also been used for the overloading of record fields, which we
use for illustration here as it is simpler.\footnote {Semi-explicit
  polymorphism will be discussed in \cref{sec/constraints/polytypes}.}

The user may define a nominal record, with \eg a single field:
\begin{program}[input]
type 'a one = {x : 'a}
\end{program}
Then, accessing field \ocaml{x} of a record is non-ambiguous, since
\OCaml takes a closed-world view:
\begin{program}[input]
let e_0 r = r.x
\end{program}
Indeed, there is a unique solution that \ocaml$r$ be of type \ocaml$'a foo$.
The user may then define another record with overlapping fields:
\begin{program}[input]
type two = {x : int; y : int}
\end{program}
Now, this can be thought of as having two abstract types \ocaml{'a foo} and
\ocaml{bar} with two accessor functions \ocaml{(_ : 'a one).x} and
\ocaml{(_:two).x} of respective types \ocaml{('a one -> 'a)} and
\ocaml{(two -> int)}, among others.
%
In the absence of overloading the latter definition would hide the former
and we fall back in \ML.  With overloading enabled, both definitions are
visible and the compiler must statically choose one of them.
%
The question is which one to choose or, equivalently, which type to infer
in the following three expressions?
\begin{program}[input]
let e_1 r = r.x
let e_2 = let r = {x = 1} in r.x
let e_3 = (fun r -> r.x) {x = 1}
\end{program}
To be able to resolve the overloading, the type of the projection should be
\emph{known} to be either (an instance of) \ocaml{'a one} or \ocaml{one}
when typing the projection.  In the new context, expression
\ocaml[indices]{e_1} is clearly ambiguous since there is no clue on the type
of \ocaml{r} and its typechecking fails\footnote {In fact, \OCaml uses a
default resolution strategy instead of failing when the type is ambiguous,
which is to use the last definition. Here, this will amount to chose the
type \ocaml{two} still leading to a failure since the record passed to the
function is actually of type \ocaml{'a one}. But we shall ignore default
resolution strategies for the moment.}\footnote {When running examples in
\OCaml,
\OCaml should be always be called with option \texttt{-principal}, since by
default \OCaml does not quite follow the theory for efficiency reasons.}.
%
By contrast, the only possible type for \ocaml{r} is \ocaml {'a one} in both
\ocaml{e_2} and \ocaml {e_3}.  Still, there is a difference.  Indeed, the
type of \ocaml{e_2} is considered to be unambiguous, while the type of
\ocaml{e_3} is ambiguous.
%
To understand why \ocaml{e_3} fails, consider the equivalent versions of
\ocaml{e_3} where \texttt{@@} and \ocaml{|>} are the application and the
reverse application functions.
\begin{program}[input,escapechar={}]
let e_4 = (fun r -> r.x) @@ {x = 1}
let e_5 = {x = 1} |> (fun r -> r.x)
\end{program}
\OCaml  does not make any difference between
\ocaml[indices]{e_1}, \ocaml[indices]{e_2}, or \ocaml[indices]{e_3}
and consider all subexpressions in an application, including the function
and all arguments as being inferred simultaneously, until they are
let-bound. More precisely, polymorphic types are considered to be known
while monomorphic types are consider to be unknown (or rather
not-yet-known). In \ocaml{fun r -> r.x}, the type of \ocaml{r} in
in the subexpression \ocaml{r.x} is not-yet-known even if equal to
\ocaml{one} since this is the lambda-bound variable~\ocaml{r}, hence in the
typing context, and therefore it is monomorphic.\footnote{Technically, all
type nodes are annotated with a special variable $\av$ called an annotation
variable, so that we may distinguish between the polymorphic binding $\xa :
\all \av. \t^\av$ that binds $r$ to the known (raw) type $\t$ and the
monomorphic binding $\xb : \t^\av$ that binds $\xa$ to the unknown (raw)
type $\t$.}


\paragraph{Limitations of directional type inference}

Directional type inference have been in used in different languages and
somehow proven to work. Still, each of them is unsatisfactory.  The main
critics of bidirectional type inference is to make a somewhat arbitrary
choice in the specification of the flow of information, typically in
applications: should the function be typed first and its codomain be
used to improve the typing of its argument or, on the opposite, should the
argument be typed first and be used as the type of the codomain of the
function?  There are examples when the former is a better choice and others
when the latter is preferable---but typing rules have to choose one of the
two alternative forever.  One may also allow information to flow between
multiple arguments passed to the same function, or on the opposite disallow
it entirety. Again, there is no best choice. We eventually have a complete
algorithm with respect to a spec that made somewhat arbitrary choices.

\Geninst-directional type inference seems a better fit for \ML, since it relies
on polymorphism which is the essence of \ML. Still, it does not even allow
to propagate user-provided type annotations from a function to its argument!
For example, the following would be rejected as ambiguous with
\geninst-directinal type inference alone:
\begin{program}[input]
let g : ('a one -> int) -> int = fun f -> f {x = 1} in g (fun r -> r.x)
\end{program}
However,, \OCaml, which use \geninst-directional type inference as the primary
mechanism, also uses a weak form of bidirectional propagation,
by passing the expected type of the argument so that
\ocaml{(fun r -> r.x)} is typed with the expected type
\ocaml{('a one -> int)} and this considered non-ambiguous.
%
Besides, the implementation of \geninst-directional type inference has an
algorithmic cost: for technical reasons, variable annotations must un-share
types (from acyclic graphs as naturally produced by unification to trees),
which may increase the size of types and the cost of type inference. For
that reason, the implementation of \OCaml cheats and is incomplete by
default. The user must explicitly pass the \texttt{-principal} flag to
require the more expensive computation of principal types when desired.

\paragraph{The relative completeness of directional type inference}

Both bidirectional and \geninst-directional type inference rely on an
ordering for type propagation that is partially specified, explicitly or
implicitly, to take advantage of user-provided type annotations and
already-inferred types to alleviated the need for extra annotations.
%
While they come with \emph{complete} algorithms, this is with respect to
their specifications, which include some choices that are subjective and may
sometimes look arbitrary.

Indeed, they all reject examples as ambiguous when sometimes they would be a
unique well-typed solution, as seen in the limitation of directional type
inference.  The first source of incompleteness results from the ordering
enforced between the resolution of core-language constraints that prevents
some core information to be taken into account when resolving ambiguities.

However, the resolution of each ambiguity is another source of
incompleteness, which is actually three-fold:
\begin{enumerate}
\item\label {item/order}
  the resolution is not considering type information from all ambiguous
  nodes into account.
\item\label {item/info}
  the resolution is not taking all contextual type information from
  each ambiguous node into account.
\item\label {item/simultaneous}
  each ambiguity node is solved independently of other, yet unresolved ones;
\end{enumerate}
Let us consider a few more examples:
\begin{program}[error]
let e_6 r = (r.x, r.y)
let e_7 = let getx r = r.x in getx {x = 1}
let e_8 r = (r.x : bool)
let e_9 r = r.x.x
\end{program}
All examples are ambiguous for \OCaml\footnote{Its succeeds on \ocaml{e_6},
using the default choice, but it fails if we inverse the order of the type
declarations.}.  However, \ocaml{r} can only be of type
\ocaml{two} in \ocaml{e_6}. Indeed, considering the second projection first,
we should learn that \ocaml{r} is of type \ocaml{two} and since it is
$\lambda$-bound, this should then make the first projection unambiguous.
The failure is a matter of solving the constraint in the right order, which
should wishfully be eliminated by omnidirectional type inference.
This illustrates case~\ref {item/order}.

\OCaml also fails on \ocaml$e_7$, since it typechecks the let-binding first,
where it fails as ambiguous, while omnidirectional type inference
has a view on the whole program and know from the body of the let-binding
that the instance of $getx$ must have type \ocaml"int one -> int" and is
therefore its let-bound type (scheme) should be \ocaml$'a one -> 'a$ and is
non-ambiguous.

In \ocaml{e_8}, the only possible type is \ocaml{one} if we take into account
the return of the projection. This illustrates case~\ref {item/info}.
However, there may be a design choice of whether we allow the return type of
the projection into account before we have resolved the projection as non
amnbiguous.

Our proposal with omnidirectional type inference succeeds
on \ocaml{e_6}, \ocaml{e_7}, and \ocaml{e_8}.\Xdidier{to be checked}
%% \Xgabriel{Does it? My implementation with Olivier would reject this example,

%% and let the example we solve them all.  We should also do better than OCaml
%% wihout default clauses (which is the case).}
Omnidirectional still fails on \ocaml{e_9}, which is an instance of the
case~\ref {item/simultaneous} of incompleteness. Indeed, it requires to
consider both projections simultaneously to conclude that the type of
\ocaml{r} must be \ocaml{one}.

Requiring an order in which overloarding sites could be solved one after the
other is actually a reasonable design to keep type inference effective,
since the complexity of general overloading without such a restriction is
NP-hard, even in the absence of let-polymorphism, as shown by an encoding of
3-SAT problem as shown by~\citet
{Chargueraud-Bodin-Dunfield-Riboulet/jfla2025}.

\paragraph{Omnidirectional type inference}

The idea of \emph{omnidirectional} type inference is to take all program
core-expression constraints into account before resolving ambiguities. This
requires typing constraint to be solved in disorder.
%
This approach eliminates the source~\ref {item/order} of incompleteness.  It
leave design space for the source~\ref {item/info}, but intendedly keeps
source~\ref {ref/simulteanous} of incompleteness by design.

Our proposal with omnidirectional type inference will
correctly type all examples above (from \ocaml{e_1} to
\ocaml{e_8})\ignorespaces
\INFO
{See \url
{https://gitlab.inria.fr/remy/semiun/-/blob/main/su/examples/record_fields.ml}}
---without any default strategy mechanism.

In absence of polymorphism, type inference is solely based on unification
constraints which can be solved in any order; omnidirectional inference is
then natural and easy to implement.  The difficulty originates from \ML
let-polymorphism for which all known implementations choose to always infer
the type of a let-binding, turn it into a type scheme that is assigned to
the let-bound variable to extend the typing environment in which the body is
then typed. The Hindley-Milner algorithm $\mathcal{J}$, one of its variant
$\mathcal{W}$ or $\mathcal{M}$~\cite {Lee_Yi/algoM@toplas1998}, or more
flexible constraint solving algorithms all follow this strategy.
However, it is not mandatory.

\paragraph {Constraint-based type inference}

In fact, typing constraints as presented by~\citet {Pottier-Remy/emlti} can
be instantiated before they are fully solved, although this comes at the
cost of duplicating some computation.  Still, this shows that the
let-binding ordering is a convenience, not a requirement.

In the~\textit{constraint-based} approach, type inference
is split into two stages, mediated by the language of \textit{constraints}
\citep{TODO}.  In the first stage, a term $\e$ is translated into a constraint
$\C$ which is satisfiable if and only if the term $e$ is well-typed. In the
second stage, the generated constraint $\C$ is solved (or shown to be
unsatisfiable).
%
The idea of treating typing judgments as typing constraints, which first
appeared in~\cite{Remy/mleth,Remy/thesis}, was popularized by ~\citet
{Odersky-Sulzmann-Wehr@tpos} with the \HMX framework---the Hindley-Milner
system parameterized by a constraint domain $X$, allowing constraints to
appear within types, and later extended by \citet{Pottier-Remy/emlti} who
fully decoupled constraint generation from constraint solving.  The central
innovation in their system for the reduction of type inference to constraint
solving is the inclusion of term variables in the language of constraints.

Our insights into directionality builds on this work, which we extend with
with two technical devices to efficiently achieve omnidirectional type
inference for fragile \ML extensions:
\begin{enumerate*}
\item
  We introduce \emph{suspended match constraints} as a way to suspend
  ambiguity resolution until sufficient information has been found from
  context so that they can be discharged and hopefully resolved.
\item
  We work with partial types schemes, \ie we the ability to instantiate type
  schemes that are not yet fully determined and consequently revisit their
  instances when they are being refined, incrementally. This allows
  inferring parts of a \texttt{let}-body to disambiguate its definition,
  without duplicating constraint-solving work.
\end{enumerate*}

These technical devices are introduced once and for all---in a general
framework of constraint-based type inference. Each fragile \ML construct can
then be implemented as suspended constraints that expand to its robust
counterpart once the annotation has been inferred. This generality comes at
a cost, which is that everything is hard:
\begin{itemize}
\item Implementing partial types schemes (without duplicating
  constraint-solving work) is hard.
\item Giving an adequate semantics for suspended constraints is also hard, as we
  must capture declaratively the intuition that some type information must be
  \emph{known} rather than \emph{guessed}, but also that some programs
  that are semantically non-ambiguous (there is a unique fully-annotated
  version that is well-tyedp) must still be rejected as ambiguous to prevent
  us from looking into suspended constraints.
\end{itemize}
In return, we found that the declarative semantics of suspended constraints
immediately suggests a systematic way to present user-facing typing rules
for each fragile construct, for which the implementation is correct and
complete.

\subsubsection* {Plan}

The rest of the paper is organized as follows.
\begin{enumerate*}[label={}]
\item
  In \cref{sec:constraints}, we give an overview of suspended constraints
  and their application to various extensions for \ML.
\item
  In \cref{sec:semantics}, we describe suspended constraints and their semantics.
\item
  In \cref{sec:language}, we define an extension of \ML featuring static
  overloading and semi-explicit first-class polymorphism along with its
  typing rules. Here we give the precise definition of the constraint
  generation translation and state the theorems of soundness and
  completeness.
\item
  In \cref{sec:solving}, we provide a formal definition of our constraint
  solver as a series of non-deterministic rewriting rules.
\item In \cref{sec:implementation}, we describe an efficient implementation
  of suspended constraints. We discuss some extensions of suspended
  constraints that we have prototyped but whose theory is less clear.
\item
  In \cref{sec:related-work} and \cref{sec:future-work}, we discuss related
  and future work.
\end{enumerate*}

\Xdidier {I think we should
\begin{itemize}
\item
  Move the typing rules before the semantic of constraints.  It is simpler
  and far less technical
\item
  Move the polytype (2.2) story to the introduction after the record field
  story.
\end{itemize}
}

\subsubsection* {Our contributions}

Our contributions are
\begin{enumerate*}
\item
  A novel \emph{omnidirectional} type inference technique for
  extensions of \ML with advanced features, based on two new devices,
  suspended constraints and partial type schemes;

\item A declarative semantics of suspended constraints that captures the
  idea that they wait on information that must be propagated from the
  context, not \emph{guessed}.

  This includes, in particular, a new declarative caracterisation of
  \emph{known} type information.

\item
  A complete yet efficient constraint-solving type inference algorithm.

\item New declarative type systems for static overloading of constructors
  and fields, and for semi-explicit first-class polymorphism, and their
  implementation using suspended constraints.
\end{enumerate*}

\citep{TODO} perspective, in which type inference
is split into two stages, mediated by the language of \textit{constraints}
\citep{TODO}.

In the first stage, a term $\e$ is translated into a constraint
$\C$ which is satisfiable if and only if the term $e$ is well-typed. In the
second stage, the generated constraint $\C$ is solved (or shown to be

% HMX

A key framework for constraint-based type inference is \HMX
\cite{Odersky-Sulzmann-Wehr@tpos}---the Hindley-Milner system parameterized
by a constraint domain $X$, allowing constraints to appear within types. Our
work is inspired by the presentation of \HMX by \citet{Pottier-Remy/emlti}

% Syntax!

Building atop the constraint-based type inference framework of
\citet{Pottier-Remy/emlti}, we adopt a constraint language that includes both
term and type variables. Its syntax is given in~\Cref{fig:constraint-syntax}.
We write $\Types$ the set of types and $\Typesz$ the subset of nonvariable
types.
%
The constraint language contains tautologic constraints ($\ctrue$),
unsatisfiable constraints ($\cfalse$), and logical conjunctions ($\cone \cand
\ctwo$). The constraint form $\cexists \tv \c$ binds an existentially
quantified type variable $\tv$ in $\c$, while the constraint $\cfor \tv \c$
binds $\tv$ universally. The constraint form $\cunif \tone \ttwo$ asserts that
the types $\tone$ and $\ttwo$ are equal.
%
For convenience, we use the notation $\ts \leq \t$ as syntactic sugar for the
constraint $\cexists \tvs \cunif \tp \t$, where $\ts$ is a universally
quantified type $\tfor \tvs \tp$; its intended meaning is the instantiation of
the polymorphic type $\ts$.

% Constraint abstractions

There are two constructs that deal with the introduction and elimination of
constraint abstractions. As the name suggests, a constraint abstraction
$\cabs \tv \c$ can simply be seen as a function which when applied to some
type $\t$ returns $\c \where {\tv := \t}$. Constraint abstractions are
introduced by a let-construct $\clet \x \tv \cone \ctwo$ which
binds the constraint abstraction to the term variable $\x$ in
$\ctwo$---additionally ensuring the abstraction is satisfiable. They are
eliminated using the application constraint $\capp \x \t$ which applies the
type $\t$ to the abstraction bound to $x$.

% Suspended match constraints

Finally, we introduce \textit{suspended match constraints}\footnote {Previously
dubbed `frozen constraints' \citep{TODO}}. These constraints defer resolution
until the \textit{shape} of a type, such as its top-level
constructor\footnote{We intentionally leave the notion of shape underspecified
here; it is formalized in \cref{sec:semantics}.}, is known. Once the shape is
determined (typically through unification), the constraint selects a matching
branch from a list of cases. Formally, a suspended constraint is written as
$\cmatch \t \cbs$, where:
%
\begin{enumerate}
\item
  The matchee $\t$ is a type. The constraint remains suspended until the
  shape of $\t$ is determined.
\item
  $\cbs$ is a list of branches of the form $\cbranch \cpat \c$, where each
  shape pattern $\cpat$\footnote{Patterns are also left unspecified for now.}
  describes a structural form of the shape.
  %
  For example, the pattern $\tva \to \tvb$ matches function types, binding the
  argument and return types to $\tva$ and $\tvb$ respectively. The constraint
  $\c$ is then solved in the extended context.
  %
  To ensure determinism, the set of patterns $\bar \cpat$
  must be \emph{shape-disjoint} -- that is, no shape may be matched by more
  than one pattern in the list.
\end{enumerate}

% Informal semantics
Suspended match constraints thus express case analysis on the structure of
types in a delayed, declarative form. Once the shape of $\t$ is known, a unique
branch is selected and its associated constraint is solved. If the shape is
never determined, the constraint remains unsatisfiable.

% Applications

The remainder of this section illustrates the role of suspended constraints
in supporting \emph{fragile} language features as defined above.
These include:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Semi-explicit first-class polymorphism.
  \item Constructor and record label overloading for nominal algebraic
  datatypes;
  \item Overloaded tuple projection in the style of \SML;
  \TODO{We need to introduce tuple projections in this section}
\end{enumerate}
We demonstrate how the typablity of each of these features can be elaborated
into constraints, formalized using a constraint generation function of the
form $\cinfer \e \tv$, which, given a term $e$ and expected type $\tv$,
produces a constraint $\c$ which is satisfiable if and only if $\e$ is
well-typed. A formal account of the semantics of suspended constraints and
the declarative typing rules for these features is deferred to
\cref{sec:semantics} and \cref{sec:language}, respectively.

\subsection{Semi-explicit first-class polymorphism}
\label {sec/constraints/polytypes}

% Intro (and annotations)
Semi-explicit first-class polymorphism \citep{Garrigue-Remy/poly-ml} uses
\textit{annotated types} to track the origins of polymorphic types.
%
The type constructor $\tapoly \ts \av$ boxes a polymorphic type
$\ts$ turning it into a \textit{polytype} annotated with the annotation
variable $\av$.  Once boxed, the polytype $\tapoly \ts \av$ is considered
a monotype, thereby enabling impredicative polymorphism. Annotation variables
may themselves be generalized, yielding type schemes such as
$\tfor \av {\tapoly \ts \av}$.


% Boxing

The introduction form for polytypes is a boxing operator $\expoly
\e {\exi \tvs \ts}$ with an explicit polytype annotation $\exi \tvs \ts$
where $\tvs$ are type variables that are free in $\ts$.
%
The resulting expression has type $\tapoly {\ts \where {\tvs \is \tys}} \av$
where $\av$ is an arbitrary (typically fresh) annotation variable and $\tys$
are arbritraty types that may be used in place of the free variables $\tvs$.
The annotation variable $\av$ can thus be generalized.  That is $\expoly \e
{\exi \tvs \ts}$ can also be assigned the type scheme $\all \av {\tapoly {\ts
\where {\tvs \is \tys}} \av}$.

% Unboxing (principality restriction)

Conversely, to instantiate a polytype expression, one must use an explicit
unboxing operator $\einst \e$, which requires no accompanying type
annotation.  However, the operator requires $e$ to have a polytype scheme of
the form $\all \av \tapoly \ts \av$ and then assigns $\einst \e$ the type
$\t$ that is an instance of $\ts$. If, by constrast, $\e$ has the type
$\tapoly \ts \av$ for some non-generalizable annotation variable $\av$, then
$\einst \e$ is ill-typed.  It is precisely the polymorphism of $\av$ that
ensures that the polytype is indeed known and not being inferred.

% Example ill-typed term

In particular $\efun \x {\einst \x}$ is not typable, since the
$\lambda$-bound variable $\x$ is assigned a monotype. Consequently, the
only admissible type for $\x$ is $x : \tapoly \ts \av$ for some $\ts$ and $\av$.
However, since $\av$ is bound in the surrounding context at the point of
typing $\einst \x$, it cannot be generalized prior to unboxing, rendering the
term ill-typed.

% Annotations

However, type annotations can be used to freshen annotation variables.
We usually omit annotation variables in annotations, since we can
implicitly introduce fresh ones in their place. For example,
$\efun {\x : \tapoly \ts {}} {\einst \x}$ which is syntactic sugar
for $\efun \x {\elet \x {(\x : \tapoly \ts {})} {\einst \x}}$, is
well-typed because the explicit annotation introduces a fresh
variable annotation $\ava$, which can then be generalized, yielding
$\tfor \ava {\tapoly \ts \ava}$.

\begin{version}{}
%% Old version
Principality is tracked using generalization.  This is done by tracking the
polymorphism of labels. Type schemes quantify not only over type variables
but $\varepsilon$ variables. As a result, a term $e$ with the type $\tapoly
\ts \varepsilon$ for some fresh $\varepsilon$ may be generalized to
$\tfor \varepsilon {\tapoly \ts \varepsilon}$.  The typing rule for
$\einst e$ in fact requires $e$'s type to be $\tfor \varepsilon {\tapoly
\ts \varepsilon}$, not just a plain polytype $\tapoly \ts
\varepsilon$. The rational is that a label is polymorphic if and only if it
is principally known and not inferred.  This is why the introduction form
for polytypes $\expoly e \ts$ is able to introduce a \textit{fresh}
$\varepsilon$ variable.
\end{version}

% Short commings of annotation variables

The very purpose of annotation variables is to distinguish \emph{known},
polymorphic polytypes from yet-unknown, monomorphic ones. However, they are
\Xdidier[somewhat difficult to understand and]{I would cut this as I
somewhat disagree...}  sensitive to the placement of type
annotation, an artifact of the fixed directionality of generalization in
\geninst-directional inference. For instance, the following two terms differ
only in the position of the annotation, yet only the one on the left-hand
side is well-typed.
\begin{mathpar}
 \efun f {\eapp {\einst {(f : \tpoly {\tfor \tv {\tv \to \tv}})}} f}

\efun f {\eapp {\einst f} {(f : \tpoly {\tfor \tv {\tv \to \tv}})}}
\end{mathpar}
The difference lies in how generalization and annotation variables interact.
In the first term, the annotation occurs in an unboxing operator introducing
fresh annotation variables and may therefore be generalized to the type
scheme $\tfor \av {\tapoly {\tfor \tv {\tv \to \tv}} \av}$, enabling
unboxing to proceed. Whereas, the second term applies the annotation to the
argument $f$, which fixes $f$'s type to the monotype $\tapoly {\tfor \tv
{\tv \to \tv}} \ava$ for some fresh annotation variable $\ava$. Because this
type is assigned to $f$ at its binding site, $\ava$ is bound in the context
when typing $\einst f$, and cannot be generalized. As unboxing requires a
generalized polytype, the second term is ill-typed despite the annotation.

% Suspended match constraints fixes this

Suspended match constraints eliminate this sensitivity to directionality,
by allowing any type information to be treated as known---rendering annotation
variables unnecessary.
Typechecking $\expoly e \ts$ is, intuitively:
\begin{mathpar}
\cinfer {\expoly \e {\tfor {\tvbs} \t}} \tva \wide\eqdef
  \parens{\cfor \tvbs \cinfer \e \t}
\cand
   \cva = \tpoly {\tfor \tvbs \t}
\end{mathpar}
If $\e$ is already known to have the type $[\ts]$, then we can simply
instantiate it.  However, if the type of $\e$ is not yet known, \ie  it is a
(possibly constrained) type variable $\tv$: then, we must defer until more
information is available.  We capture this behaviour in the following constraint:
\begin{mathpar}
\cinfer {\einst \e} \tva \wide\eqdef
    \cexists \tvb \cinfer \e \tvb
\cand
    \cmatch  \tvb {\parens {\cbranch {\tpoly s} s \leq \tva}}
\end{mathpar}
Here, the match constraint $(\cmatchdots \tvb)$ suspends the instantiation
until $\tvb$ is resolved to a polytype matching the pattern $\tpoly s$, which
binds the type scheme to the variable $s$. The selected branch then performs
the instantiation $s \leq \tva$.
%
If $\tvb$ is already known to be a polytype, the constraint discharges
immediately and behaves like a standard instantiation constraint.
%
By waiting for $e$'s type to be \emph{known}, we may ensure principal types
without annotation variables.

\subsection{Static overloading of constuctors and record labels}

% What do we mean by static overloading?

\emph{Static overloading} denotes a form of overloading in which resolution is
performed entirely at compile time, enabling the compiler to select a unique
implementation without relying on runtime information---in contrast to
\emph{dynamic overloading}, which defers resolution to runtime via
mechanisms such as dictionary-passing or dynamic dispatch.

% Other languages

Many languages offer statically resolved overloading to avoid the overhead
of dynamic dispatch. C++ and Java resolve overloaded functions through
compile-time specialization based on argument types. Conversely, languages
like Rust and Haskell primarily employ dynamic overloading via traits and
type classes, respectively, which can incur runtime overhead unless
optimized away by monomorphization and aggressive inlining.

% How it relates to OCaml?

\Xdidier {why pick other examples and not reuse those of the introductino?}
\Xalistair {I think the sections were written in parallel, we should
be able to reuse the examples from the intro}

\OCaml supports a limited yet useful form of static overloading for record
labels and data type constructors.
\begin{program}[input]
  type three = {x : int; y : int}
  type four  = {y : int; z : int}
  type five  = {x : int; z : int}
\end{program}
\programjoin
\begin{program}[input]
  type m = L | M
  type n = L
\end{program}

% OCaml's approach (PI-directionality)

When encountering overloaded labels or constructors, \OCaml resolves ambiguity
using local type information. This process is underpinned by
\geninst-directional inference, where nominal types $\tys \Tapp$ carry
annotation variables $\av$, written $\tys \Tapp^\av$, to track which types are
\emph{known}. As discussed in \cref{sec/constraints/polytypes}, this mechanism
allows one to deduce known types from generalized type constructors $\tfor \av
{\tys \Tapp^\av}$.

% A note on bidirectional expected type propagation

Because static overloading involves more intricate flows of information than
polytype instance, \OCaml complements \geninst-directionality with a
limited form of bidirectional propagation of expected types. This allows the
following to be well-typed:
\begin{program}[input]
  let e_8 = (function (L : m) | _ -> 1) L
\end{program}

% Closed-world reasoning
Beyond propagation, \OCaml also exploits \emph{closed-world reasoning} to resolve
ambiguities in record types. For instance:
\begin{program}[input]
  let e_9 = fun {x; z} -> {x = -z; z = x}
\end{program}
\programjoin
\begin{program}[output]
  val e_9 : five -> five
\end{program}
Here, \code{x} and \code{y} appear together only in the type \code{five},
allowing the type checker to unambiguously infer the type of \code{e_8} as
\code{five -> five}.

% Default rules
If local type information and closed-world reasoning are insufficient,
\OCaml falls back to a syntactic default: it selects the most recently
defined compatible type. For example:
\begin{program}[input]
  let proj$_z$ = fun {z; _} -> z
\end{program}
\programjoin
\begin{program}[output]
  val proj$_z$ : five -> int
\end{program}
The expression is compatiable with both \code{four} and \code{five},
since each defines a field \code{z}. But \code{five} is chosen simply
because it appears later in the source.
We do not treat this behaviour as principal; accordingly, we provide
no formalisation of such ``default'' rules, though their implementation is
discussed further in \cref{sec:implementation}.

This fallback mechanism highlights the directionality of \OCaml inference.
Once the compiler selects a type, it commits to it---even if that choice
causes errors downstream:
\begin{program}[input]
  let e$_{10}$ = fun r -> let x (* infers [five] *) = r.x in x + r.y
\end{program}
\programjoin
\begin{program}[error]
  Error: The expression has type five
	 There is no field y within type five
\end{program}

% Record field disambiguation in suspended constraints
We propose an alternative account of static overloading using suspended
match constraints.  For example, in the case of an ambiguous record
projection $\efield \e \elab$, we generate the typing constraint:
\begin{mathpar}
\cinfer {\efield \e \elab} \tva \wide\eqdef
  \cexists \tvb \cinfer \e \tvb
  \cand
  \cmatch \tvb
    \parens
      {\cbranch {(\wild \Tapp[t])}
	{\Omega(\elab / t) \leq \tva \to \tvb}
      }
\end{mathpar}
This constraint defers resolution until more information is available:
specifically, until the type constructor of $\tvb$ of the record expression
$\e$ is known.

We assume a global typing environment $\Omega$, which provides type scheme
declarations for
constructors and record fields. These are written in the form:
\begin{align*}
  \K : \tfor \tvs \t \to \tvs \Tapp &\in \Omega \\
  \elab : \tfor \tvs \t \to \tvs \Tapp &\in \Omega
\end{align*}
Since constructors and labels may be overloaded across distinct type
constructors, $\Omega$ may contain multiple such schemes for a given
constructor or label.  However, within a given data type, we assume that
each constructor or label is uniquely defined. Thus, we write $\Omega(\elab
/ \T)$ or $\Omega(\K / \T)$ to denote the unique type scheme associated with
a specific label or constructor in the context of the type $\T$.

Once the record type of $\tvb$ is known, the suspended constraint $(\cmatchdots
\tvb)$ is triggered. It matches against the nominal type pattern $\wild
\Tapp[t]$, binding the type constructor name to $t$. Using this, the
appropriate type scheme for $\elab$ is retrieved from $\Omega(\elab/t)$,
instantiated, and the resulting constraints are imposed on the argument and
return types of the label access.

\TODO{Do some typing constraints for the examples presented in this section}

% Suspended constraints are better

As seen in the examples above, this approach is faithful to \OCaml's current
behaviour\footnote {modulo default disambiguation rules.}, and in fact
improves on it: certain expressions, such as \code{e}$_{10}$ are well-typed
under our account but rejected by \OCaml's current type checker.

\subsection{Tuple projections \'a la \SML}

\SML supports positional projections from tuples using expressions of the form
\ocaml{#$j$ e} to extract the $j$-th component of the tuple \code{e}.

% SML typing rule
Internally, tuples in \SML are treated as structural records with numeric
labels. While the specification \cite{TODO} does not provide a dedicated typing
rule for tuple projection, its semantics are captured by the following
rule\footnote{This rule is reconstructed using the typing rules for pattern
matching of records, function applications and the syntactic sugar $\eproj \e j
\eqdef \eapp {\parens {\efun {\erecord {j = \x; \wild}} \x}} \e$}:
\begin{mathpar}
  \infer[Sml-Proj]
    {\G \th \e : \tsrecord {j = \tj; \rho }}
    {\G \th \eproj \e j : \tj}
\end{mathpar}

Here, the projection retrieves the $j$-th field from a record with tail $\rho$.
However, \SML enforces an additional restriction: the tail $\rho$ must be fully
determined (\ie cannot be a polymorphic row variable). This ensures that the
arity of the tuple is \emph{known} statically from the surrounding context,
thereby avoiding the need for row polymorphic and any associated runtime
representation overhead. The restriction is not reflected in the typing rules
themselves, but is instead enforced within \SML's type inference algorithm.

% Tuple projection is statically overloaded
From a typing perspective, tuple projection in \SML behaves like a form
of static overloading: the expression $\eproj \e j$ is valid only when $\e$ is
known to be an $n$-ary tuple for some fixed $n \geq j$. Unlike record or
constructor  overloading, the space of possible overloadings in this case is
countably infinite.

% We can precisely specify this with suspended constraints:
We can capture the typing of tuple projections precisely using suspended
constraints. For the projection $\eproj \e j$, we generate the following
constraint:

\begin{mathpar}
  \cinfer {\eproj \e j } \tv \wide\eqdef
  \cexists \tvb
    \cinfer \e \tvb
    \cand \cmatch \tvb {\cbranch {\cpatprod \tvc j} {\cunif \tva \tvc}}
\end{mathpar}

% Tuple patterns
The suspended constraint $\cmatchdots \tvb$ blocks until the shape of $\e$
($\tvb$) is known to be a tuple of sufficient arity. The pattern $\cpatprod
\tvc j$ matches only tuple shapes $\tProd \tvi$, where $n \geq j$, binding the
$j$-th component to $\tvc$, which is then unified with the expected result type
$\tva$.

% Next section

Suspended constraints offer a robust mechanism for dealing with extensions of
\ML that depend on a notion of \emph{known} type information. What remains
is to formalize this notion: that is, to give a precise semantics for when
a type variable is considered \emph{known}, and how suspended constraints
are discharged accordingly.


\section{Semantics of constraints}
\label{sec:semantics}

% Judgement shape

The semantics of constraints is given, as is standard, by a satisfiability
judgment of the form $\semenv \vdash \c$: the constraint $\c$ is satisfied
by the solution, or valuation, $\semenv$. The semantic environment $\semenv$
maps term variables to constraint abstractions of the from $\clam \cv \C$
and type variables to \emph{ground} types, \ie the subset $\Ground$ of type
expressions with no free type variables.\footnote {Ground types are thus
finite trees. In \cref{sec/rec-types}, we dissuss the alternative choice
of regular trees for the set of ground types that models equirecursive types.}

% Definition exampled

The judgment is defined, for all constraint-formers except suspended
constraints, in \cref{fig:constraint-semantics}. $\ctrue$ is satisfied in
any environment, and $\cfalse$ in none. An environment $\semenv$ satisfies
$\cone \cand \ctwo$ if it satisfies both $\cone$ and $\ctwo$. The
existential rule $\semenv \vdash \cexists \tv \c$ requires that $\semenv$
provides a ``solution'' for $\tv$: it maps it to a type $\t$ that
satisfies the expected constraints in $\c$. The universal constraint
$\cfor \tv \c$ requires $\c$ to be satisfiable under any type mapped to $\tv$
in $\semenv$. A unification constraint holds if both sides are
mapped to the exact same type under the environment.

The rule for let-bindings reflects that the constraint abstraction $\cabs
\tv \c$ must first be \emph{satisfiable}, checking that $\cone$ holds under
some instantiation of its bound variable; then the resulting constraint
abstraction is bound to $\x$ in $\semenv$ and may subsequently be used in
$\ctwo$.

Application of a constraint abstraction $\cinst x \t$ is interpreted as
follows: if the environment maps $\x$ to an abstraction $\cabs \tv \c$, then
applying $\t$ to $\x$ succeeds just when the body $\c$ of the abstraction is
satisfied after sunstituting $\tv$ for $\t$.

     \semenv, \alpha := \semenv(\t) \vdash \c}
    {\semenv \vdash \cinst x \t}
\end{mathparfig}

% Why this semantics is useful

While this semantics feels a bit tautological, the rules above, which omit
suspended constraints, are straightforward. It is a useful exercise to ensure
that we can give an explanation of each constraint-former in our
mathematical meta-language that is reasonably simple and declarative.
This specification is essential for proving properties of type inference,
such as the soundness and completeness of the constraint generator---as well
as for reasoning about the correctness of the solver.

% Example

Closed constraints are either satisfiable in the empty semantic environment
$(\cdot)$ or unsatisfiable. For example, consider the constraint $\cexists
\tv {\cunif \tv \tint}$, its satisfiability is established by the following
derivation:
\begin{mathpar}
  \infer*[Right=Exists]
    {\infer*[Right=Unif]
      {\infer*{}{\tint = \tint}}
      {\cdot, \tv := \tint \vdash \cunif \tv \tint}}
  {\cdot \vdash \cexists \tv \cunif \tv \tint}
\end{mathpar}

\subsection{Shapes}

% Definition of shape

A shape $\sh$ is a type with holes, written $\any \tvs \t$, where
$\tvs$ denotes the set of type variables representing the holes,
is exactly the free variables of $\t$.
\Xgabriel{``Existentially'' suggests that shapes are constraints. As far as
I can tell, thinking of $(\nu)$ as a $(\lambda)$ is more accurate than an
$(\exists)$.}\Xdidier {I am not sure $\lambda$ works better, but I am find
to pick another qualifier.  In fact \texttt{\string \some} woudld better
carry the idea than \texttt{\string\any} for the macro name.}
\Xalistair{Agree that $\lambda$ is not better than $\nu$.}
Hence, shaped are closed. They are treated up to $\alpha$-conversion.
%% We call $\t$ the \emph{structure}
%% of the shape, which by constrat is defined up to renaming.
We write $\bot$ for the shape $\any \tvc \tvc$, which we call the \emph{trivial} shape. We write $\Shapes$
the set of shapes and $\Shapesz$ the subset of non trivial shapes.

Shapes are equipped with an ordering---that of the standard
instantiation ordering, defined by:
\begin{mathpar}
  \infer[Inst-Shape]
    {\tvas \disjoint \any \tvbs \tone}
    {\any {\tvas} \tone \preceq \any {\tvbs} \tone \where {\tvas \is \tys}}
\end{mathpar}
When writing $\sh \preceq \shp$, we say that $\sh$ is more general than
$\shp$. When $\sh$ and $\shp$ are more general than one another, they are
actually equal. $\bot$ is the most general shape.

% Define decomposition

Given a shape $\shq \tvcs \t$, we write $\tys \shapp[\shq \tvcs \t]$ for $\t
\where {\tvs \is \tys}$. This is uniquely determined, since it is
independent of the choice of variables $\tvs$ for representing the
shape. \Xgabriel{I would expect the standard notation $\sh(\tys)$.}\Xdidier
{I would prefer this too. I reused Alistairs prefix notation. In fact, I
would prefer that we use the postfix notation for formal types everywhere
and reserve the prefix notation for examples. I can make the change if we
agree.}
\Xalistair{I'm happy to change to prefix notation}
%
A type $\t$ has a decomposition $\deshaped \sh \tys$ iff $\t = \tys \shapp$;
we say that $\sh$ is \emph{a} shape of $\t$.  A decomposition is trivial if
the shape is trivial. \Xgabriel{It is obvious that $\sh(\tys)$ is uniquely
determined in the paragraph above, but not completely obvious that the
decomposition of $\t$ as $\sh(\tys)$ is uniquely determined by
$\sh$.}\Xdidier {Why not?} \Xalistair{I also think it is fairly
obvious? To find $\tys$, just unify the shape with $\t$ treating
the variables as flexible unification variables.}

\begin{definition}
A non-trival shape $\sh$ is the principal shape of the type $\t$ iff:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item
    $\t = \tys \shapp$
  \item
    $\forall \shp \in \Shapesz, \t = \tys' \shapp[\shp]
    \implies \sh \preceq \shp$
    %% For any other non-trivial decomposition $\t = \tys' \shapp[\shp]$,
    %% $\sh \preceq \shp$
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
Any nonvariable type $\t$ has a non-trivial principal shape $\sh$.
\end{theorem}

% Define canonical shape
A shape $\any \tvs \t$ is canonical if the sequence of free variables $\tvs$
is sorted by some arbitrary ordering on bound variables. For convenience of
presentation, we take the canonical ordering to be the order in which the
variables occur in $\t$ --- although we admit that this is not always
for all shapes (but is for principal shapes).


We write $\shape \t = \sh$ for the canonical principal shape of $\t$ (if
defined). Thus $\shape {\tys \Tapp}$ is $\any \tvs \tvs \Tapp$.
Canonical principal shapes can be seen as a generalization of type
constructors, capable of coping with polytypes.
For example, the polytype  $\tpoly {\all \tva
  {\parens{\tpoly {\all \tvb {\parens{\tvb \to \tint \tlist}} \tprod \tvb}
  \to \tva}
  \to \tva}}$  can be decomposed as:
\begin{mathpar}
\deshaped
  [\tvc]
  {\tpoly {\all \tva
     {\parens{\tpoly {\all \tvb \parens{\tvb \to \tvc} \tprod \tvb} \to \tva}
    \to \tva}}}
  {\parens{\tint \tlist}}
\end{mathpar}

The canonical principal shape of a type governs its decomposition. We write
$\decomp \t$ for the decomposition of $\t$ induced by its canonical principal
shape, if it exists, and $\tys \pshapp$ for the recomposition of a type where
$\sh$ is a canonical principal shape.

\begin{version}{}
%
Match functions $f$ operate on the principal decompositions, requiring the
property of \emph{uniformity}:
\begin{mathpar}
  \forall (\any \tvs \t) \in \Shapesz,
  \forall % \tvps, \tys, \uad
  (\any \tvps \t \where {\tvs \is \tys}) \in \Shapes,
  \uad %\implies
    \cexists \tvs {\cunif \tvs \tys \wedge f(\t)}
    \cequiv f(\t \where {\tvs \is \tys})
\end{mathpar}
\Xgabriel
{I would call this \emph{uniformity} rather than parametricity.\Xdidier{I
committed.} I believe that the definition is wrong: for example, it is not
the case a-priori that $(\exists \tv. f(\tv \tlist)) \equiv f(\tint
\tlist)$. Instead we want to ask that if the substitution $\theta$ witnesses
$\sh \leq \sh'$ then we have $f(\sh') \cequiv f(\sh)[\theta].$}\Xdidier{Is
this fixed?}

\Xgabriel{Many remarks in the rest of the text below read incorrectly if we
consider that $\bot$ is a valid shape. Should we consider defining shapes in
a way that actually rules $\bot$ out? Then the decomposition $\ty =
\sh(\tys)$ becomes a partial relation, and/but I think this is
fine?}\Xdidier {Yes, I know. But the trivial shape first the definition
based on the ordering.}
\end{version}


\subsection{Suspended constraints}
\paragraph {An attempt}

To extend these semantics to our suspended constraints, a first natural idea
is to propose the following rule---henceforth referred to as the
\emph{natural semantics} of suspended constraints:
\begin{mathpar}
\infer[Susp-Nat]
  {\cmatches \cpati {\decomp {\semenv(\t)}} \theta \\
   \semenv, \theta \th \ci}
  {\semenv \vdash \cmatch \t {\cbranch {\bar \cpat} {\bar \c}}}
\end{mathpar}

% Explain the rule
This rule states that a suspended constraint is satisfied by $\semenv$ whenever
there exists a unique branch $\cbranch \cpati \ci$ whose pattern $\cpati$
matches the principal shape of the ground type $\semenv(\t)$\footnote{This is
guaranteed to be defined by Theorem ??.}. The match yields a substitution
$\theta$ that binds the subcomponents introduced by the pattern. The
corresponding branch constraint $\ci$ must then be satisfied under the extended
environment $\semenv, \theta$. In effect, the principal shape of
$\semenv(\t)$ provides the structural information needed to discharge the match
constraint, while $\theta$ ensures correct scoping of the extracted components.

% Matching is unique and deterministic
Suspended match constraints require that, if a pattern matches a given shape,
then the match is unique and unambiguous. However, we do not require the set of
branches to be exhaustive: if no pattern matches the shape, the constraint is
unsatisfiable by definition.

% Matches predicate
We have thus far left the syntax of shape patterns deliberately abstract,
as it is extension-specific. Accordingly, the matching predicate
$\cmatches \cpat {\tys \pshapp} \theta$ is also left unspecified. This
predicate matches a pattern $\cpat$ against a principal shape $\sh$ with
components $\tys$, yielding a substitution $\theta$ for any variables bound in
the pattern.

% Wildcard patterns
For illustrative purposes, we define the trivial pattern $\cwild$, which matches
any shape and binds no variables. Its semantics are given by:
\begin{mathpar}
  \cmatches \cwild {\tys \pshapp} \eset
\end{mathpar}

% Good example
Consider the constraint $\cexists \tv \cunif \tv \tint \cand \cmatch \tv
{\cbranch \cwild \ctrue}$. This is satisfiable under the current
semantics, as shown by the derivation:
\begin{mathpar}
\def \cmatchex {\cmatch \tv {\cbranch \cwild \ctrue}}
\def \semenv {\cdot, \tv \is \tint}
  \infer*[Right=Exists]
  {
    \infer*[Right=Conj]
    {
     \infer*[Left=Unif]
      {\tint = \tint}
      % -------------------------------
      {\semenv \vdash \cunif \tv \tint}
     \\
     \infer*[Right=Susp-Nat]
      {
	\cmatches \cwild {\cdot \pshapp[\tint]} \eset
	\\
	\infer*[Right=True]
	  {\,}
	  % ---------------------
	  {\semenv \vdash \ctrue}
      }
      % ------------------------
      {\semenv \vdash \cmatchex}
    }
    % -----------------------------------------------
    {\semenv \vdash \cunif \tv \tint \cand \cmatchex}
  }
  % -----------------------------------------------------------
  {\cdot \vdash \cexists \tv \cunif \tv \tint \cand \cmatchex}
\end{mathpar}

In this case, the shape of $\tv$ is first determined by the unification with
$\tint$, allowing a solver to deduce that $\tv$'s shape is \emph{known}
from the surrounding context of the match constraint. This unlocks the
match constraint and permits the resolution of the corresponding branch
constraint ($\ctrue$)---precisely as intended.

% The problem
However, the semantics also permits less desirable behaviour. Consider the
constraint: $\cexists \tv \cmatch \tv {\cbranch \cwild {\cunif \tv \tint}}$.
Here, the shape of $\tv$ is unconstrained prior to solving the match branch,
suggesting that the constraint should be unsatisfiable. Yet under the
natural semantics, it is considered satisfiable:
\begin{mathpar}
\def \cmatchex {\cmatch \tv {\cbranch \cwild {\cunif \tv \tint}}}
\def \semenv {\cdot, \tv \is \tint}
  \infer*[Right=Exists]
  {
    \infer*[Right=Susp-Nat]
    {
      \cmatches \cwild {\cdot \pshapp[\tint]} \eset
      \\
      \infer*[Right=Unif]
        {\tint = \tint}
	% -------------------------------
	{\semenv \vdash \cunif \tv \tint}
    }
    % ------------------------
    {\semenv \vdash \cmatchex}
  }
  % -----------------------------------
  {\cdot \vdash \cexists \tv \cmatchex}
\end{mathpar}
In this case, the semantics les us \emph{guess} the type of $\tv$
and use it to unlock the match constraint, rather than requiring it to be
known from the surrounding context. This does not match the intended meaning
of suspended match constraints, and raises several problems:
\begin{enumerate*}

  \item A reasonable solver---one that avoids guessing or backtracking---cannot
    be complete with respect to this semantics.

  \item More seriously, this breaks the existence of principal solutions.
    Consider the function $\efun \x \efield \x 2$, which projects the second
    component of a tuple. Under the current semantics, the generated constraint
    permits us to guess any tuple type of arity at least two to be guessed for
$\x$. But there is no most general tuple type encompasing all such sizes---so
no principal type exists for $\x$. \end{enumerate*}

\paragraph {Contextual semantics}

Rather than relying on the guesswork inherent in the natural semantics,
we adopt a \emph{contextual} semantics. This formulation ensures
the shape is \emph{known} from the surrounding context.
% Open/use rule for suspended constraints
First, we introduce a simplified variant of the natural rule
(\Rule{Susp-Nat}) that only applies when $\t$ already has a shape:
\begin{mathpar}
  \infer[Susp-Use]
    { \shape \t \Defined \\
      \cmatches \cpati {\decomp \t} \theta \\
      \semenv, \semenv(\theta)  \th \Ci
    }
    {\semenv \vdash \cmatch \t {\cbranch {\bar \cpat} {\bar \c}}}
\end{mathpar}
Unlike the natural rule, which considers the shape of $\semenv(\tau)$, which
may contain parts that have been ``guessed'' in $\semenv$, this version demands
that the shape of $\t$ must already be known in the constraint ($\shape \t
\Defined$), statically. Hence, it does not allow to guess.

% Contextual rule

The key innovation of the contextual semantics lies in the following rule,
which---unlike the others---is not syntax-directed:
\begin{mathpar}
  \infer[Susp-Ctx]
    {\Cshape \C \tv {\any \tvcs \t} \\
      \semenv \th \C \where {\cexists \tvcs \cunif \tv \t
                             \cand \cmatch \t \cbs}
    }
    {\semenv \vdash \C \where {\cmatch \tv \cbs}}
\end{mathpar}
This rule lets us substitute the matchee variable $\tv$ by a more defined
non-variable type $\t$, provided the constraint context $\C$ determines $\tv$
to have precisely the shape $\any \tvcs \t$.
%
The side-condition $\Cshape \C \tv {\any \tvcs \t}$ ensures this
precisely: it expresses that the context $\C$ constrains all the solutions
of $\tv$ to have the \emph{same} principal shape $\any \tvcs \t$,
modulo $\alpha$-equivalence of shapes. The formal definition of this condition,
which is somewhat technical, will be introduced later.

In other words, we can \emph{discover} a shape, as in the natural semantics,
but only if ambient constraint context $\C[\square]$ guarantees that there
is a unique possible shape.  This rule is typically used in combinatino with
\Rule {Susp-Use} which can then be used in the proof of the right-hand-side
premise.

% Examples

We illustrate the contextual semantics for suspended constraints
with a series of examples.
\begin{example}
Consider the two examples from above:
\begin{mathpar}
\cexists \tv \cunif \tv \tint
  \cand
  \cmatch \tv {\cbranch \cwild \ctrue}

  \cexists \tv \cmatch \tv {\cbranch \cwild {\cunif \tv \tint}}
\end{mathpar}
In the first example, we apply the contextual rule with the context $\C :=
(\exists \tv. \tv = \tint \cand \square)$. Any solution $\phi$ of this part
of the constraint necessarily has $\phi(\tv) = \tint$, therefore the shape
of $\tv$ is uniquely determined. The side condition of \Rule{Susp-Ctx}
rule is therefore satisfied , and the suspended constraint can
be resolved.

In constrast, the second example has no contextual information around
the suspended constraint ($\C[\square] = \square$), so any solution
$\semenv$ satisfies it, and $\tv$ can take an arbitrary shape in this context.
Consequently, the uniqueness condition fails, the \Rule{Susp-Ctx} rule
cannot be applied, and the constraint remains unsatisfiable---as intended.
\end{example}
\begin{example}
Consider the more intricate example:
\begin{mathpar}
  \cexists {\tva \tvb}
  \Parens{\begin{array}{l}
    \quad \cmatch \tva {\cbranch \cwild {\cunif \tvb \tbool}} \\
    {} \cand \cmatch \tvb {\cbranch \cwild \ctrue} \\
    {} \cand \tva = \tint
  \end{array}}
\end{mathpar}
To prove that this constraint is satisfiable we can use the \Rule{Susp-Ctx}
twice, once with a hole around the suspension on $\tva$, and once with a
hole around the suspension on $\tvb$. In fact, this can be done in any order:
\begin{itemize}
\item
  If you focus on $\tva$ first, it is easy to prove that the context around it,
    $(\square \cand \cmatchdots \tvb \cand \cunif \tva \tint)$, imposes a
    unique solution thanks to $\cunif \tva \tint$. Then, we use the
    $\Rule{Susp-Ctx}$ rule in the context $((\cmatch \tint {\cbranch \cwild
    {\cunif \tvb \tbool}}) \cand \square \cand \cunif \tva \tint)$, and we have
    to prove that $\tvb$ is uniquely determined in this context. This is in
    turn proved by using the conjunction rule followed by \Rule{Susp-Use},
    which gives us access to the unification $\cunif \tvb \tbool$.

\item
  If you focus on $\tvb$ first, proving that $\tvb$ is uniquely determined
    in the context $(\cmatch \tva {\cbranch \cwild {\cunif \tvb \tbool}} \cand
  \square \cand \cunif \tva \tint)$ requires using the \Rule{Susp-Ctx} again as
  in the case above. Then, we end up with the constraint $(\cmatchdots \tva
  \cand \cmatchdots \tbool \cand \tva = \tint)$, and we can use
  \Rule{Susp-Ctx} yet another time on $\alpha$.

\end{itemize}
This example illustrates that the declarative semantics supports arbitrary
orders of resolution for suspended constraints---as long as the contextual
conditions are met. This flexibility accommodates both top-down and
bottom-up reasoning styles.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
Finally, let us consider a constraint with a cyclic dependency between match
constraints:
\begin{mathpar}
  \cexists {\tva \tvb}
  \left(\begin{array}{l}
    \quad \cmatch \tva {\cbranch \cwild {\cunif \tvb \tbool}} \\
    {} \cand \cmatch \tvb {\cbranch \cwild {\cunif \tva \tint}}
  \end{array}\right)
\end{mathpar}

This constraint can be proved satisfiable with the ``natural semantics'' that
we proposed earlier, by guessing the instantiation $\tva \is \tint, \tvb \is
\tbool$. Our solver fails on it, and so does our contextual semantics.
Without loss of generality, suppose that we try to use \Rule{Susp-Ctx} on
$\tva$ first: we get to prove $\Cshape \C \tva \tint$ for the context $\C :=
(\square \cand \cmatch \tvb {\cbranch \cwild {\cunif \tva \tint}})$: we have
to prove that $\tint$ is a unique head structure for $\tva$ such that
$\C[\ldots]$ is satisfiable. But this does not hold, as the constraint
  $(\cmatch \tvb {\cbranch \cwild {\cunif \tva \tint}})$ cannot be solved: we
cannot use the \Rule{Susp-Use} rule yet as $\beta$ has no head, and we cannot
use the \Rule{Susp-Ctx} rule as the empty context $\square$ does not uniquely
constrain $\tvb$.

This example illustrates a key distinction between the natural and contextual semantics:
while the former allows unconstrained guessing, the latter requires well-foundedness in constraint
dependencies, ensuring that resolutions are guided by contextual information rather than arbitrary choice.
\end{example}

\subsection{Technical details}

Having motivated and illustrated the semantics of suspended constraints,
we now turn to some of the more technical details before summarizing the
rules. We begin defining the so-called unicity predicate, the condition
under which a variable's shape can be considered uniquely determined by
a context.

\paragraph{Unicity predicate}
A key ingredient of the contextual rule \Rule{Susp-Ctx} is determining
when a type variable's shape is uniquely fixed by its surrounding
constraint context. We formalize this using the unicity predicate
$\Cshape \C \tv \sh$, which expresses that within the context
$\C[\square]$, the variable $\tv$ must have shape $\sh$ in any
satisfying assignment.

\begin{definition}
  A type variable $\tv$ has a \emph{uniquely known} principal shape within the
  context $\C[\square]$, written $\Cshape \C \tv \sh$, iff for all assignments
  $\semenv$ and ground types $\t$, then $\semenv \vdash \C[\cunif \tv \t]$
  implies that the principal shape of $\t$ is equal to $\sh$.
%
  In other words:
  \begin{mathpar}
    \Cshape \C \tv \sh \Wide\eqdef \forall \semenv, \t \in \Ground, \uad
      \semenv \vdash \C[\cunif \tv \t] \implies \shape \t = \sh
  \end{mathpar}
  This condition ensures that we’re not guessing a shape arbitrarily;
  the shape must already be determined by the ambient constraint.
\end{definition}

\paragraph{Well-foundedness}

The astute reader may have noticed a compilication resulting
from our definition of the unicity predicate:
$\Cshape \C \tv \sh$ contains a negative occurrence of the
satisfiability judgement, in order to express that $\sh$
is unique among all solutions of the ambient context $\C$.
%
This negative occurrence means that \emph{a priori}, the rules
from \cref{fig:constraint-semantic} including \Rule{Susp-Use}, \Rule{Susp-Ctx}
do not form an inductive definition in the usual sense.

This is not merely a technical quirk: it threatens the foundational
structure of the semantics. If left unaddressed, it would prevent
us from interpreting the rules as a well-behaved inference system.

However, it can easily be resolved by obersving that the rules, while not
syntactically well-founded, can be defined in a decreasing way by noting
that the conclusion of \Rule{Susp-Ctx} $\C[\cmatch \tv \cbs]$ is structurally
larger than the negatively-occurring judgement $\C[\cunif \tv \t]$.

Instead of consdering the rules defined above as a \emph{single}
inductive definition, we consider them to determine a function
$\bbrackets -$ from constraints $\c$ to sets of valuations $\semenv$.
The satisfiability relation is defined as
$\semenv \vdash \c \iff \semenv \in \bbrackets \c$.
We can prove that $\bbrackets \c$ is well-defined by
metered recursion of~$\c$. Furthermore, we show that the
inference rules we have so far defined hold and are
invertible.  We give the full details for this in \Cref{appendix:wf}.
This ensures that the semantics is well-defined, even if not syntactically
inductive.

\paragraph{Interaction with polymorphism}

\Xalistair{I'm not too sure this belongs here, but I think
it is a tricky part of our semantics}

Suspended constraints interact subtly with polymorphism
and let-generalisation. Though our semantics appears modular,
it is carefully crafted to give us the desired properties.
%
% Partially generalised type schemes (example)
To illustrate, let us consider again \code{e}$_{10}$:
\begin{program}[input]
type three = {x : int; y : int}
...
let e$_{10}$ r = let x = r.x in x + r.y
\end{program}
A simplified typing constraint for this program is:
\begin{mathpar}
  \cexists \tv
    \clet x \tvb {\cmatchdots \tva }
      {\cinst x \tint \cand \cunif \tv {\mathsf{three}}}
\end{mathpar}
Here, $\tv$ is \code{r}'s type. The constraint suspends
until the shape of \code{r}'s type becomes available, which occurs when typing
\code{r.y} using closed-world reasoning of records.

% Generalisation
At the point of generalising \code{x}, the type $\tvb$
remains unknown: it is captured by a suspended match constraint
and has not yet been refined. We must nevertheless assign a type
scheme to $x$, yielding $\tfor \tvb \tvb$.
This appears unsound---$\tvb$ is generalised despite depending on
unresolved information. However, $\tvb$ is not `fully' generalised in
the traditional sense: it may be (and is) further constrained once the match
constraint is discharged.

To support this, we introduce our second novel mechanism for omnidirectional
type inference: \emph{partial type schemes}.  Such type schemes (\ie $x$'s
scheme) delay commitment to certain quantifications, allowing generalised
variables like $\tvb$ to be later refined (\eg, to \code{int}) once
suspended constraints are discharged. We defer the solver-level details of
this mechanism to \cref{sec:solver, sec:implementation}.  At the semantic
level, we simply note that partially generalised schemes arise naturally
from the interaction of suspended constraints and let-abstractions.

% Backpropagation

A further subtle---but crucial---feature of our semantics is its support for
\emph{backpropagation}.
%
\Geninst-directional inference, as exemplified by \OCaml, performs inference
in a strictly let-directional manner:
each let-binding is inferred using only local information,
\Xdidier{not quite true---monorphic parts are non locally inferred, but
they are not part of the known information}\Xdidier{This repeats, less
precsisely, I think from what has been told in the introduction. Perhaps,
the introduction should be more detailed, but repeateing it here, which a
different story could be confusing} and generalisation forms a boundary that
prevents information from later use sites from influencing the generalised
type--this is why polymorphic type information is considered `known'.

\Xdidier
{There is now  a variant of this example \ocaml$e_7$ in the introduction.
Could we be reused it here instead of using another one?}
For example, the following program is rejected by \OCaml:
\begin{program}[input]
  let e$_{11}$ = let getx r = r.x in getx {x = 1; y = 1}
\end{program}
Yet this example ought to be well-typed: the type of \code{f}'s
argument is unambiguously the record type \code{three}. The reason
this is ill-typed is that \geninst-directional inference cannot propagate
the known type of the record (\ie \code{three}) \textbf{back} to
\code{f}'s type.

By contrast, our approach permits such refinement.
The (simplified) constraint generated when typing \code{e}$_{11}$ is:
\begin{mathpar}
  \cexists \tv
  \clet f \delta
     {\cexists {\tvb, \tvc} \Parens {\strut
        \cunif \delta {\tvb \to \tvc} \cand
        \cmatchdots \tvb
        }}
    {\cinst f {(\mathsf{three} \to \tv)}}
\end{mathpar}
Here, type information flows from an instance constraint ($\cinst f
{(\mathsf{three} \to \tv)}$) into a potentially generalisable variable
$\tvb$ within the constraint abstraction.  At generalisation time, $\tvb$
remains abstract. However, at the use site, the instance type \code{three}
is known, and thus uniquely determines the shape of $\tvb$ to be
$\mathsf{three}$. The unicity predicate can be used to show that no other
shape can be inferred, without the constraint being unsatisfiable.

This controlled backpropagation allows us to resolve the suspended constraint
\emph{without} requiring $\tvb$ to be marked as a non-generalisable variable.

\TODO{derivation}

\paragraph{Summary}

To recap, the semantics of suspended constraints is governed by three
principles:
\begin{enumerate*}
  \item If the shape of the matchee is statically known, we use it
    directly via \Rule{Susp-Use};
  \item If not, we may guess the shape--but only when the context ensures
    the shape is unique, via the $\Cshape \C \tv \sh$ condition and
    \Rule{Susp-Ctx};
  \item If the shape cannot be uniquely inferred from the context, the constraint
    is unsatisfiable.
\end{enumerate*}

These rules, together with the base rules from
\cref{fig:constraint-semantics}, define the full semantics. For convenience,
we collect all the rules pertaining to the satisfiability judgement in
\cref{fig:contextual-semantics}.

% Contextual semantics is cool, and our approach extends to type systems
Together, these rules define a flexible but principled system for constraint resolution,
capable of both deferring and resolving shape information as determined by the constraint context.
Importantly, the same style of contextual reasoning extends naturally to the static semantics of terms.

\begin{version}{}
\Xgabriel{Maybe reuse what's below.}
Our conclusion is that the na\"ive semantics should be rejected in favour
for the semantics of our informal solver. Our intent with suspended
constraints is that the blocking variable should not be guessed out of thin
air, but deduced from the surrounding context without knowledge of the
constraint generated by the handler.

The idea, inspired by type systems that require principality (such as
FreezeML), is to stipulate that the only satisfying assignments for the
context of the suspended constraint requires $\cv$ to be assigned to some
type with a unique type constructor.

\Xdidier{We are missing an introduction to the semantics of constraints}


A na\"ive denotation semantics for suspended constraints would be to simply
apply the assignment of $\cva$ to $f$. More formally,
\begin{mathpar}
  \inferrule*
    {\semenv(\cva) = \overline{\t} \Fapp \\ \semenv_{\setminus
    \Delta}[\overline{\cvb := \t}] \vdash f(\overline{\cvb} \Fapp)}
    {\semenv \vdash \cmatch \cva \Delta f}
\end{mathpar}
However, our informal solver would be incomplete with respect to this
semantics.  We show this by considering the constraint $\cexists \cv
\cmatch \cv \cv (\lambda \_.~ \cv = 1)$.  This constraint does not
unify $\cv$ outside the suspended constraint, but once it is scheduled,
the variable $\cv$ must be unified with the unit type $1$. So our
informal solver suggests that this constraint is unsatisfiable since
$\cv$ is never unified outside the match constraint. Yet we can use the
above rule to show that this constraint is satisfiable:
\begin{mathpar}
  \inferrule*
    {
      \inferrule*
        {
          (\cv \mapsto 1)(\cv) = 1 \\
          \inferrule*
            {(\cv \mapsto 1)(\cv) = 1} {\cv \mapsto 1 \vdash \cv
            = 1}
        }
        {\cv \mapsto 1 \vdash \cmatch \cv \cv (\lambda \_. ~ \cv
        = 1)}
    }
    {\cdot \vdash \cexists \cv \cmatch \cv \cv (\lambda \_.~ \cv = 1)}
\end{mathpar}
The dependency of suspended constraints can also be complex, as in the
following example: $\cexists {\cva, \cvb} \cmatch \cva \cvb {(\lambda
\_. ~ \cvb = 1)} \cand \cmatch \cvb \cva {(\lambda \_. ~ \cva = 1)}$.
Worse still, is that the binding location of $\cva$ may not even contain
the sufficient information to show that $\cva$ is realised.  For instance,
\begin{align*}
  \cexists \cvb \cvb = 1 \cand \cexists \cva \cva = \cvb \cand \cmatch \cva \Delta f
\end{align*}

Our conclusion is that the na\"ive semantics should be rejected in favour
for the semantics of our informal solver. Our intent with suspended
constraints is that the blocking variable should not be guessed out of thin
air, but deduced from the surrounding context without knowledge of the
constraint generated by the handler.

The idea, inspired by type systems that require principality (such as
FreezeML), is to stipulate that the only satisfying assignments for the
context of the suspended constraint requires $\cv$ to be assigned to some
type with a unique type constructor.
\Xalistair[]{This doesn't read entirely correctly, we want a unique
constructor for all assignments}.

This motivates our next definition: the principal realisation of a type
variable $\cv$ by some constraint context $\cctx[-]$.

\begin{definition}
  A type variable $\cv$ is principally realised with the constructor $\F$
  by the context $\cctx[-]$, written $\cctx[\cv !] \rhd \F$,
  iff for all assignments $\semenv$, there exists an assignment $\semenvp$
  for the
  hole such that $\semenv \vdash \cctx[\semenvp \vdash \ctrue]$ implies
  $\semenvp(\cv) = \overline{\t} \Fapp$
\end{definition}

\TODO
{Here, we not only rely on the definition of a constraint with a hole
$\mathcal{C}[-]$ but a judgement with a hole and some way to translate
between the two. We'll need formal definitions for this.}

\TODO
{Some examples of principal realisation}

As we've previously hinted, the semantics for a suspended constraint must
require that the surrounding context principally realises the matchee. This
is formally specified as:
\begin{mathpar}
\inferrule*
   {\cctx[\cva !] \rhd \F \\
    \semenv \vdash \cctx[\semenvp_{\setminus \Delta}[\overline{\cvb :=
      \t}] \vdash f(\overline{\cvb} \Fapp)] \\
    \semenvp(\cva) = \overline{\t} \Fapp}
   {\semenv \vdash \cctx[\semenvp \vdash \cmatch \cva \Delta f]}
\end{mathpar}

\TODO: precise declarative semantics of constraints. They should coincide
with the semantics of the typing rules.

Alistair has yet another proposal derived from his simplification of his
timestamp semantics.

\TODO
{derive precise declarative semantics for the language features of
Section 2.}


Meta-substitution lemma: if $\semmetav$ occurs exactly once in $\c$, then
$\semmetaenv, (\semenvp \vdash \semmetav); \semenv \vdash C$ and $\semenvp
\vdash \cp$ if and only if $\semmetaenv; \semenv \vdash \c[\semmetav :=
\cp]$.

Convention: we write $\c[\cp]$ for $\c[\square := \cp]$. In particular
$\c[\square] = \c$ when $\square$ occurs once in $\c$.

Next steps:
\begin{itemize}
\item introduce the condition
  $\c[\cv !]$:
  \begin{mathpar}
    \begin{array}{l}
    \exists! \F, \quad \forall \semenv, \semenvp,\\ \qquad (\semenvp \vdash
    \square); \semenv \vdash \c[\square] \implies
    \mathsf{head}(\semenvp(\cv)) = \F
    \end{array}
  \end{mathpar}
\item and finally the global rule
  \begin{mathpar}
    \infer
    {\c[\cva !]
      \and \semenvp(\cva) = \overline{\t} \Fapp
      \and \semmetaenv, (\semenvp, \overline{\cvb := \t} \vdash
      \square)\vdash \c[f(\overline{\cvb} \Fapp)] }
    {\semmetaenv, (\semenvp \vdash \square); \semenv \vdash \c[\cmatch \cva \Delta f]}
  \end{mathpar}
\end{itemize}

The intuition for the judgment $\semmetaenv, (\semenvp \vdash \square);
\semenv \vdash \c[\cp]$ is that it is a proof of satisfiability of
$\c[\square := \cp]$ with valuation $\semenv$, where we furthermore know
that the $\cp$ sub-derivation has the valuation $\semenvp$. Note that, after
the the global rule is added, the derivations of this judgment are not
syntactically directed by $\c$ anymore.

\section{The language}
\label{sec:language}

\Xdidier{We need to add structure to this section, with subsections}

% Running example: tuple projection disambiguation

% We need a spec, but this itself is hard

In order to show our approach is sound and complete with respect to our
constraint generation translation, we must first define a formal
specification in the form of a calculus and accompanying type
system. Surprisngly, identifying an appropriate declarative type system to
use as a specification is itself an interesting problem!

% Why is it hard? Examples of prev work:

\Xdidier {This paragraph is repeating (or should be added to) the
introduction}
Much work has been done on various extensions of \ML with features such as
static overloading \citep{TODO} and first-class polymorphism
\citep{TODO}. However, many of these approaches either fail to ensure
principality or require intricate menachisms -- such as labelled types -- to
do so.

% Why do naive approaches not guarantee principal types.

Na\"ive specifications, though accessible, often lack principal types. Take
overloaded tuple projects \textit{\`a la \SML}: an expression $\efield e j$
governed by the rule:
\begin{mathpar}
  \infer
    {\G \th \e : \Pi\iton \ti \and 1 \leq j \leq n}
    {\G \th \efield \e j : \tj}
\end{mathpar}
admits many typings, as any tuple of at least size $j$ satisfies the
premise. This multiplicity undermines principality.

% Partial annotations (shapes) to the rescue!

Our first insight is that partial type annotations often suffices to
recover principality. We refer to these annotations as \textit{shapes}. For
example, explicitly annotating the tuple projection with its arity, as in
$\exfield \e n j$, disambiguates the expression:
\begin{mathpar}
   \inferrule*
      {\G \th \e : \Pi\iton \ti \\ 1 \leq j \leq n }
      {\G \th \exfield \e n j : \tj}
\end{mathpar}
Yet, requiring users to write such annotations manually is impractical.

% Inference of shapes

Our solution is to permit \textit{inference} of shapes, provided that the
inferred annotation is \textit{uniquely determined by context}.  This
approach ensures principality by construction and yields a clear
specification with predictable annotability requirements for the everyday
programmer.

% A note on stratified type inference

\Xdidier {This paragraph should also fit into the introduction, I think}
The idea of leveraging a principled core language with inference of shapes
is not novel. \textit{Stratified type inference}
by~\citet{Pottier-Regis-Gianas/stratified@popl06} pursued a similar goal---in
the context of generalized algebraic data types. It operates in two phases:
the first phase transforms the program into an intermediate language and
generates shapes using \textit{bidirectional typing}; the second performs
\HM type inference for the intermediate language. While the second phase is
sound, complete and enjoys principal types, the overall system remains
incomplete due to the heuristic nature of the first phase.

% How do we specify our intuition?

Specifying the notion of unique inferrability from context is
tricky. Luckily, we can leverage many of the formal methods developed in the
previous section---in particular, the manipulation of contexts within the
derivation=--to prove uniqueness of shapes. Allowing us to
systematically replace the ambiguous constructs with their disambiguated
counterparts:
\begin{mathpar}
  \inferrule*
    {\eshape \E e {\Pi\iton \tvs} \\ \G \th E[\exfield \e n j] : \t}
    {\G \th \E[\efield \e j] : \t}
\end{mathpar}
The intuition here is that the context $E$ is sufficiently large to
constrain the shape of $e$'s type as a tuple of size $n$.

% Limitations

The chief limitation of our approach is that disambiguation can still
require explicit annotations in inherently ambiguous scenarios.  This is
fine. Another option would be the use of sensible ``defaults'', such as
resolving $\efield e j$ by assuming the tuple has arity $j$. While
appealing, such defaults compromise principality. We return to this
pragmatic tradeoff in \cref{sec:implementation}.

}\\
\end{bnffig}

\paragraph{Terms}

In \cref {fig/syntax}, we give the grammar for our calculus. Terms include
all of the \ML calculus: variables $x$, the unit literal $\eunit$,
lambda-abstractions $\efun x e$, applications $\eapp \eone \etwo$,
annotations $(e
: \t)$ and let-bindings $\elet x \eone \etwo$. Our extensions include:
\begin{enumerate}
\item
  Constructor and record label disambiguation, modelled using record
  literals $\erecord { \labone = \eone; \ldots; \labn = \en }$ and field
  projections $\efield e l$.

\item
  Tuples $(\eone, \ldots, \en)$ with overloaded tuple projections
  $\efield e i$.

\item
  For semi-explicit first-class polymorphism, we have the boxing construct
  $\epoly \e$  and the unboxing construct $\einst e$.

\end{enumerate}
Each construct that endangers principality (written $\e^i$) has an
explicitly annotated counterpart (written $\e^x$) that is $\erecord {\overline{\ell / \F = \e}}$, $\eproj [\F] \e
\elab$, $\eproj [n] \e j$, $\epoly [\exi \tvs \ts] \e$, or $\einst [\exi
\tvs \ts] \e$.

\paragraph{Types}

As usual, types are split into monotypes (or just types) and type
schemes. Types $\t$ include the variables $\tv$, the unit type $1$, function
types $\tone \to \ttwo$, $n$-ary product types $\Pi_{i = 1}^n \ti$ and
nominal record types $\tys \F$. Type schemes $\sigma$ extend monotypes
allowing the universal quantification of zero or more type variables $\all
\tvs \t$. We write $\tv, \tvb, \tvc$, \etc for type variables.  We also have
polytypes \textit{without the annotations} $[\ts]$ as monotypes.

\paragraph{Typing contexts}

Tying contexts $\Gamma$ are an ordered sequence of expression variable
typings $x : \sigma$ and universally quantified type variables. Our
presentation of \ML explicitly tracks the type variables in scope in the type
context $\G$. (This may differ from traditional presentations that permit type
variables to ``float around''.)

As usual, the main typing judgment $\G \th \e : \ts$ states that in context
$\G$, expression $\e$ has type scheme $\ts$.  Typing rules are given on
\cref {fig/typing}.  They use auxiliary typing judgemnents $\G \th \elab :
\ts$ and $\G \th \elab = \e : \ts$ and an instance typing judgement
$\mlsub [\G] \ts \tsp$.

% Simple typing rules explained

\Xdidier {I am not sure that we need and will have space to read in details
the typing rules of Core \ML}

Rule \Rule{Var} retrieves the type scheme $\x : \ts$ from the context $\G$.
Function types are introduced via lambda abstractions: in Rule \Rule{Fun}, the
system guesses a well-formed type $\tone$ for the type of $x$, typechecks
the body $e$ is under the extended context $\G, \x : \tya$ producing the
return type $\tyb$, and assigns the abstraction the function type
$\tya \to \tyb$. Conversely, function types are eliminated by applications;
in Rule \Rule{App}, the type of the argument must match the function's parameter
type $\tya$ and application returns the type $\tyb$. Rule \Rule{Unit} asserts
that $()$ has the unit type $\tunit$.

% Gen/Inst explained

Rules \Rule{Gen} and \Rule{Inst} correspond to implicit
\textit{generalization} and \textit{instantiation} respectively.
Generalization universally quantifies a type variable $\tv$, introducing it
as a fresh polymorphic variable in the typing context. In \Rule{Inst}, we
specialize a type scheme $\tsa$ to $\tsb$ using the \emph{instantiation
relation} given in \cref{fig:inst-rel}.  This expresses that one type scheme
is a polymorphic generalization of another.

% Instantiation relation
\Xdidier {Is there a reason to use an intermediate instantiation relation,
rather than just a Rule \Rule {Inst}---since there is already a rule \Rule
{Gen}, which we must keep?}

Rules \Rule{Inst-Refl} trivially asserts that a monotype is an instance of
itself. In \Rule{Inst-ForallL}, a universally quantified type on the left may be
instantiated by substituting $\tv$ with any monotype to match the right hand
side. Conversely, \Rule{Inst-ForallR} has a type scheme $\tfor \tv \ts$ on the
right-hand side. In this case, we introduce a fresh polymorphic type variable
$\tv$ into the context to test whether the $\tsa$ is an instance of $\tsb$
under any instantiation of $\tv$---this is essentially a form of skolemization.

% Let rule

Let-polymorphism is handled by the \Rule{Let} rule, where a \textit{polymorphic}
term can be bound. This allows a single definition to be instantiated differently
at each use site---an essential feature of \ML. In this rule, the term $\eone$
has a polymorphic type scheme $\ts$, adds $\x : \ts$ into the context $\G$ to
typecheck $\etwo$.

% Annotations

Annotations $(e : \exi \tvs \t)$ ensures that the type of $e$ is (an instance
of) the type $\t$. The type variables $\tvs$ are
\emph{flexibly} (or existentially) bound in $\t$, meaning that $\tvs$ may be
unified with some types $\tys$ to produce a well-typed term. For instance,
the term $(\efun x x + 1 : \exi \tv
\tv \to
\tv)$ is well-typed with $\tv := \tint$ in \Rule{Annot}.

% Contextual rules (Poly-*, Use-*, Proj-*)

\subsection {Shape-aware typing rules}

The typing rules for fully annotated terms ($\e^x$) are unsurprising.
However, typing rules for terms with omitted type annotations are
non-compositional as they depend on a surrounding one-hole context
$\E$. Hence, they assert that the typability of the expression $\G \th \E
\where {\e^i}: \t$ where $\e^i$ is an expression with an implicit type
annotation.
%
We first request a typing for the expression with an explicit annotation $\G
\th \E \where {\e^x}: \t$ where $\e^x$ is a fully annotated variant of $\e^i$.
We then request that (the shape of) the annotation is fully determined from
context, either from the type of the expression, which we write $\eshape \E
\e \sh$, or from the type of the hole, which we write $\Eshape \E \e \sh$.

Shapes are one of the following form:
\begin{mathpar}

\entry{\sh}{
       \tunit
  \and \tva \to \tvb

\end{bnfgrammar}

\Xalistair{This syntax is a bit odd for polytypes as no other shape quantifies
over its monomorphic part}\Xdidier{Initially, shapes where just
constructors for me---not shallow terms}\Xdidier{The syntax is not enough:
we should ensure that all type variables are disjoint, so that shapes are
equivalent to constructors..., even for polytypes thanks to the existence of
a canonical representation.}\Xdidier {Shapes should be closed, or we should
be clearer with $\alpha$-conversion.}

The shape of a variable is undefined (as in \cref{fig:shape-fn-def-typing}).
The shape of the unit type $\tunit$ is $\tunit$. Monotypes that contain
nested types, such as the function type $\t \to \tp$, have the shape of
their top-level type constructor with their children replaced by variables,
\ie $\tva \to \tvb$.
%
The shape of a polytype $\tpoly \ts$ is the \emph{polytype skeleton} of
$\tpoly \ts$ abstracted over the monomorphic parts. It is the minimal
closed type expression $\exi \tvas {\tpoly {\all \tvbs \t}}$ (up to the
ordering of variables) such that there exists types $\tys$ such that
$\tfor \tvbs \t \where {\tvas \is \tys}$ is equal to $\ts$.
%
Closed, means that $\tvas$ is equal to the free type variables
$\ftv \ts$ of $\ts$. The minimality condition is equivalent to the fact that
any suffix of a non-variable node in $\t$ leads to a polymorphic type
variable, \ie a variable in $\tvbs$.
%
When $\exi \tvs \tpoly \ts$ is a polytype skeleton, we write $\cpoly \tys
\ts$ for the polytype $\tpoly \ts \where {\tvs \is \tys}$.

\end{version}
\begin{version}{\True}
We use letter $\sh$ to range over shapes, which are a generalization of the
notion of type constructor $\F$ to cope with polytypes.  As shape is an
existentially closed quantified linear shallow type type $\exi \tvs \t$.
That is,
\begin{itemize}

\item
  $\tvs$  $\tvs$ are the free variables of $\t$

\item
  $\t$ is linear, \ie each type variable $\tv$ in $\tvs$ occurs eactly only
  once in $\t$,

\item
  $\t$ is shallow, which means the following:
\begin{itemize}

\item
  when $\t$ is not a polytype, all subterms of $\t$ are variables.

\item
  when $\t$ is a polytype $\tpoly {\all \tvbs \tsp}$, then all subterms of
  $\tsp$ that do not lead to a polymorphic variable $\tvb$ in $\tvbs$
  are a variable in $\tvs$.

\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
For example, the shape of a type $\tys \F$ is $\exi \tvs \tvs \F$ where
$\tvs$ is a tuple of disjoint variables of length the arity of $\F$.  The
shape of $\tpoly {\all \tv {(\tv \to \tv) \to \tvb \to \tvb}}$ is $\exi \tvb
{\tpoly {\all \tv {(\tv \to \tv) \to \tvbp}}}$.  The shape is defined up to
the ordering of quantifiers. We may require $\tvs$ to be be in their order
of appearance in $\t$.

The shape of a variable is undefined and we write $\deshaped \t = \bot$ or
$\deshaped \t \Undefined$.  The shape of a nonvariable monotype $\t$ is always
defined, which we write $\deshaped \t \Defined$ and is unique up
$\alpha$-renaming. We may then write $\deshaped \t = \sh$.

A nonvariable monotype can be uniquely decomposed into a pair $\deshaped
\tvs \tyz \tys$ such that $\t$ is equal to $\tyz \where{\tvs \is \tys}$ and
$\exi \tvs \tyz$ is the shape of $\t$.  We then write $\t = \deshaped
\tvs \tyz \tys$.

\end{version}

\paragraph {Unavoidable shapes}

In order to describe the judgments $\eshape \E \e \sh$ and
$\Eshape \E \e \sh$, we introduce a cast operation $\ecast \e \t \tp$
that allows an expression $\e$ of type $\t$ to be seen with type $\tp$.
That is the typing rule for casts is:
\begin{mathpar}
  \inferrule[Cast]
    {\G \th e : \t}
    {\G \th \ecast e \t \tp : \tp}
\end{mathpar}
Casts expressions are not allowed on source terms and are just a device for
the definition of unavoidable shapes.  Finally, we define what it means for a
shape to be determined from the type of a context or an expression:
\begin{mathpar}
\def \Eqdef {&\eqdef&}
{\begin{tabular}{RCL}
\eshape E \e \sh \Eqdef
  \forall \G, \t, \tp, \uad
  \G \th E \where {\ecast \e \typ \typp} : \t \wedge \deshaped \typ \downarrow
      \wide\implies \deshaped \typ = \sh
\\[1ex]
\Eshape E \e \sh \Eqdef
  \forall \G, \t, \tp, \uad
      \G \th E\where{\ecast \e \typ \typp} : \t \wedge \deshaped \typp \downarrow
      \wide\implies \deshaped \typp = \sh
\end{tabular}}
\end{mathpar}
These states that the shape $\sh$ of expression $\e$ in context $\E$ is
determined by the expression $\e$, in the former case, or by the context
$\E$ in the latter case.

%% Shapes are equal modulo alpha equivalence and the removal of useless
%% polymorphic type variables. They do not have useless existential variables.

\paragraph {Structural tuples and polytypes}

% Expression-based implicit rules

The implicit rule \Rule{Proj-I} types the projection $\eproj \e j$ provided the
context $\E$ \emph{infers} that the shape of $\e$ must be a tuple with arity $n$.
Similarly, \Rule{Use-I} permits instantiating a polytype in $\einst e$ if
the context $\E$ infers that the type of $\e$ must be a polytype with skeleton
$\exi \tvs \tpoly \ts$. The rule \Rule{Poly-I} types the implicit boxing
construct $\epoly \e$ by \emph{checking} the expected type of $\epoly \e$ in the
context $\E$ is a polytype with the skeleton $\exi \tvs \tpoly \ts$. This rule
differs from the previous two as the shape is determined by the expected type
within the context as opposed to the inferred type of $\e$.


\paragraph {Nominal records}

% Labels

We adopt a similar non-compositional approach for elaborating overloaded labels,
whether in record projection ($\efield e \elab$) or record construction
($\erecord {\overline{\elab = \e}}$), although the definitions are slighly
more involved.  Here, a one-hole label context $\Lab$
provides the surrounding context in which a label $\elab$ may appear:
\begin{mathpar}
\begin{bnfgrammar}
\entry [Label contexts]{\Lab}{
    \E \where {\e.\square} \and
    \E \where
         {\erecord
            {\elaba = \eone; \ldots; \square = \ei ; \ldots; \elab_n = \en}
         }
}
\end{bnfgrammar}
\end{mathpar}
We then require that the record type $\F$ associated with $\elab$ is
uniquely determined.  This is expressed by the judgment $\Lshape \Lab \elab
\F$, which holds if either:
\begin{enumerate*}
\item \label{enum/lab/1}
  the label $\elab$ can be uniquely resolved to a record type $\F$ in the
  typing context, written $\eshape \Lab {\elab ~} \F$;
\item \label{enum/lab/2}
  the context $\Lab$ infers that $\elab$ must be instantiated to the record
  type $\tys \Fapp$, written $\Eshape \Lab \elab \F$.
\end{enumerate*}
We thus define:
\begin{mathpar}
  \Lshape \Lab \elab \F \Wide \eqdef
     \eshape \Lab \elab \F \vee \Eshape \Lab \elab \F
\end{mathpar}
Case~\ref {enum/lab/1} applies when the record type is uniquely determined by the
syntax of the context, without needing shape inference. There are two main
subcases:
\begin{enumerate*}[label*=\textbf{(\alph*)}]
\item
  in a record projection context $\E[\e.\elab]$, if the label $\elab$ is not
  overloaded, then the global record typing context $\labenv$ assigns a
  unqiue record type $\F$ to $\elab$;

\item
  in a record expression $\E [\erecord {\elab_1 = \eone; \ldots; \elab_n =
  \en}]$, if the set of labels ${ \elab_1, \ldots, \elab_n }$ uniquely
  identifies a record type $\F$ in the typing context $\labenv$.
\end{enumerate*}
\begin{mathpar}
  \infer[Lab-Uniq-Proj]
    {\elab \mathop{!} \F \in  \labenv}
    {\eshape {\E[\e.\square]} \elab \F}

  \infer[Lab-Uniq-Rcd]
    {\bar \elab \mathop{!} \F \in \labenv}
    {\eshape
      {\E[\erecord
            {\elaba = \eone; \ldots; \square = \ei; \ldots;  \elab_n = \en }]}
      \elab \F }
\end{mathpar}
To support case~\ref {enum/lab/2} case, we introduce a casting label judgment
(\Rule{Lab-Cast}) that behaves analogously to the cast operator in
expression contexts. It enables us to assume that a hole $\square : \t$ in
label position may be instantiated to a function type $\tp \to \t$:
\begin{mathpar}
  \infer[Lab-Cast]
    {}
    {\G \th \square : \t \leq \tp \to \t}

\Eshape \Lab \elab \F \Wide\eqdef
   \forall \G, \t, \tp, \G \th \Lab[\square : \tp] : \t \implies
        \deshaped \tp.1 = \tvs \F
\end{mathpar}

% Contexts can be the entire term

\subsection {Examples of typings}

The following lemma shows that we can always take a larger context
$\E$ or $\Lab$ for implicit rules \Rule {Proj-I}, \Rule {Use-I}, \Rule {Poly-I}
and \Rule{Lab-I}.
That is, there is always a derivation using only toplevel contexts.
\begin{lemma}
\label{lem/context/largest}
\newcommand {\Eab}{\parens{\Ea\where \Eb}}
Assume $\eshape \Eb \e \sh$ and $\G \th \Ea \Where {\Ga \th \Eb \where
{\e^x} : \tya} \t$, then $\eshape \Eab \e \sh$ and $\G \th \Eab\where {\e^i}
: \t$.  Similarly, for label contexts, assuming $\Lshape \Lab \elab \F$ and
$\G \th \E [\Ga \th \Lab[\elab] : \tya] : \t$, then $\Lshape {(\E[\Lab])}
\elab \F$ and $\G \th (\E[\Lab])[\elab] : \tau$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}[Proof Sketch]
Formally, can be proved by induction on $\Ea$ and $\E$, respectively.
\end{proof}

% Examples
We now illustrate the typing of implicit constructs with a few examples.
\begin{example}
To illustrate a simple case of non-typability, we show that the expression $e$
equal to $\efun \x {\eproj \x k}$ is ambiguous, \ie that it does not
typecheck.
%
%% Let $e_n$ be the explicitly annotated version $\efun r
%% {\eproj[n] \x i}$. for $n \le k$.
If there is a derivation of $\efun r
{\eproj \x k}$ then there must be one of the form:
\begin{mathpar}
\infer*[Right=Proj-I]{
                        \eshape E \x {\Pi\iton} \\
                \eset \th E \where {\eproj[n] \x k} : \t_k
}{%             -------------------------------------------
                  \eset \th E \where {\eproj \x k} : \t_k
}
\end{mathpar}
where $E$ is the term $\efun \x \ehole$, which is the largest possible
context, thanks to~\cref {lem/context/largest}.
%
Let $\t$ be $\Pi\iton \ti \to \t_k$.  We have the following derivation:
\begin{mathpar}
\infer* [Right=Fun]{
          \infer*[Right=Proj-X]
                {\x : \Pi\iton \ti \th \x : \Pi\iton \ti}
                {r : \Pi\iton \ti \th \eproj[n] \x k : \t_k}
}{%      ----------------------------------------------------------
         \eset \th E \where{\eproj[n] \x k} : \t
}
\end{mathpar}
Unfortunately, $\eshape E  \x {\Pi\iton}$ does not hold.
Indeed, we have $\eset \th E \where {\ecast \x {\t_n} {\t_k}} : \t$
for any $\t_n$ of the form $\Pi\iton \tys$ and $n \ge k$.
Hence, $\Pi\iton[k]$ and $\Pi\iton[k+1]$ are two possible shapes
for the type of $\x$.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
\locallabelreset
We now illustrate a non-ambiguous example, showing that the
expression $e$ equal to $\th \eapp {(\efun \x {\eproj
\x  k})} {(1, 2)} : \tint$.
%
Let $k$ and $n$ be $1$ and $2$.
%
Let $E$ be the context $\th \eapp {(\efun \x \ehole)} {(1, 2)} : \tint$.  We
have the derivation:
\begin{mathpar}
\infer* [Right=Proj-I]{
                        \eshape E \x {\Pi\iton} \\
                \eset \th E \where {\eproj[n] \x k} : \t_k
}{%             -------------------------------------------
                  \eset \th E \where {\eproj \x k} : \t_k
}
\end{mathpar}
We have $\eset \th E \where {\eproj[n] \x k} : \t_k$, indeed.
Therefore, it just remains to show $\eshape E \x {\Pi\iton}$~\llabel C.
Assume $\eset \th \E \where{\ecast \x \typ \typp} : \t_k$. Since
$\x: \Pi\iton (\tint,\tint)$ is bound in the context at the hole $E$,
there is no other choice but take $\tp$ equal to $\Pi\iton (\tint,\tint)$,
hence $\tshape \tp = \Pi\iton$, which proves~\lref C.
\end{example}

The following example of non-typability illustrates how the typing rules
still forces to reject typing of some expressions whose annotations would be
unambiguous. This is intended, to prevent us from having to focus at several
annotation simultaneously. Our typing rules enforce the resolution of
annotations, locally, one at a time.

\begin{example}
\newcommand{\tyid}{\ty_{\kwd{id}}}
\newcommand {\epid}[1][]{\epoly[#1]{\efun z z}}
Let $\tyid$ be $\tpoly{\all \tv \tv \to \tv}$.
%
We show that the expression $e$ equal to $\elet \x {\epoly {\efun z z}}
{(\eapp {\einst \x} 1, \eapp {\einst \x} \eunit)}$ is rejected as ambiguous.
Let $\tyid$ be $\tpoly {\all \tv \tv \to \tv}$.  Clearly, we have $\elet \x
{\epoly [\tyid] {\efun z z}} {(\eapp {\einst[\tyid] \x} 1, \eapp
{\einst[\tyid] \x} \eunit)}$.  This is actually the only possible fully
annotated derivation.
%
To show that $e$ is typable, we must be able to make all annotations
optional, sequentially.  Therefore, the final step, which will eliminate the
last annotation has a single point of focus of the form $\E\where{e^i}$,
where $\e^i$ can be any of the three positions with a missing annotation.  We
consider each case independently, and show that it is actually not typable.
\proofcase
{$\E$ is $\elet \x \ehole (\eapp {\einst \x} 1, \eapp {\einst \x}\eunit)$}
%
If this holds, we should have a derivation that ends with
\begin{mathpar}
\infer*[Right=Poly-I]{
                         \Eshape \E \epid \tyid \\
                  \eset \th \E \where {\epid [\tyid]}: \t
}{%               ---------------------------------------
                       \eset \th \E \where \epid : \t
}
\end{mathpar}
However, $\Eshape \E {\epoly {\efun z z}} {{\tpoly \tyid}}$ does not hold.
Indeed, the following judgment
$\eset \th \E \where {\ecast \epid {\tpoly \ts} \wild} : \t$ where
$\ts$ is either $\all \tv \tv \to \tv$ or $\all \tv (\tv\to\tv) \to
\tv\to\tv$. Hence, the shape of the type of $\epid$ is not uniquely
determined and this case cannot occur.

\proofcase
{$\E$ is
 $\elet \x \epid (\eapp {\einst \ehole} 1, \eapp {\einst \x} \eunit)$}
%
The derivation must end with:
\begin{mathpar}
\infer*[Right=Proj-X]{
                          \eshape \E \x \tyid \\
                \eset \th \E \where {\einst[\tyid] \x} : \t
}{%             -------------------------------------------
                    \eset \th \E \where {\einst \x} : \t
}
\end{mathpar}
However, $\eshape \E \x \tyid$ does not hold (the proof is similar to the
previous case).

\proofcase {$\E$ is  $\elet \x \epoly {\efun z z} (\eapp {\einst \ehole} 1, \eapp
{\einst \x} \eunit)$} This is symmetric to the previous case, which cannot
hold either.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
Let $\e$ be $\elet f {\efun \x {\eproj \x 1}} {\eapp f (1, 2)}$.
We should that $\e$ is well-typed.
$\e$ is of the form $\E \where {\x}$ where  $\E$ is the context $\elet f
{\efun \x \ehole} {\eapp f (1, 2)}$.
We have $\eset \th \E \where {\eproj[2] \x 1} : \tint$.
Let us show that $\eshape \E \x {\Pi\iton[2](\tint, \tint)}$.
%
Assume $\eset \th \E \where {\ecast \x \typ \typp} : \t$
and $\deshaped \typ \Defined$. Thus is, the type $\typ$ of $\x$ is not a
variable.  Then,  $\typ$ cannot be that of an arbitrary record, since
there is not such type as a record of arbitrary size. Hence,
$\typ$ must be a record of some shape $\Pi\iton$ for some size
$n$. Since the codomain of $f$ must be a tuple of size~$2$, then $n$ must
also be $2$. This shows that $\eshape \E \x {\Pi\iton[2]}$.

\subsection{Constraint generation}
\label{sec:constraint-gen}

% Intro
We now present the formal translation from terms $\e$ to constraints $\C$,
such that the resulting constraint is satisfiable if and only if the term is
well typed. The translation is defined as a function $\cinfer \e \t$, where $\e$
is the term to be translated and $\t$ is the expected type of $\e$.

% Explanation of expected type
The expected type $\t$ is permitted to contain type variables, which can be
existentially bound in order to perform type inference. The models of constraint
$\cinfer \e \t$ interpret the free variables of $\t$ such that
$\t$ becomes a valid type of $\e$. For example, to infer the entire type of $\e$
we may pick a fresh type variable $\tv$ for $\t$.

% Explanation of constraint gen cases
% Simple constraint gen

The function $\cinfer - {\mathop{=}}$ is defined in
\cref{fig:constraint-gen}.  We assume that all variables $\tv_i$
existentially bound by the translation are fresh.\Xdidier {I do nor
understand this, since we are using explicit existential binders.}
%
Unsurprisingly, variables generate an instantiation constraint. Unit $()$
requires the type $\t$ to be $\tunit$. A function generates a constraint
that binds two fresh flexible type variables for the argument and return
types.  We use a $\Let$ constraint to bind the argument in the constraint
generated for the body of the function. The $\Let$ constraint is monomorphic
since $\tvc$ is fully constrained by type variables defined outside the
abstraction's scope and therefore cannot be generalized.  An application
binds two fresh flexible type variables for the function and argument types
and ensures $\t$ is the return type of the function. A Let-binding generates
a polymorphic let constraint; $\cabs \tv {\cinfer \e \tv}$ is a principal
constraint abstraction for $\e$: its intended interpretation is the set of
all types that $\e$ admits.

% New constraint gen cases

\TODO{Explain new constraint gen cases}


% Soundness/completeness of constraint gen

The translation is sound and complete with respect to the typing judgment.
That is to say, the term $e$ is well-typed if and only if $\llbracket e : \alpha
\rrbracket$ is satisfiable.

  Given a well-formed assignment $\semenv$. Then $\semenv \th \cinfer \e
  \tv$ if and only if $\floor \semenv \th \e : \semenv(\tv)$.

\subsection{Type system properties}
\label{sec:constraint-prop}


\paragraph{Stability by program transformations}

A well-known property of \ML is to admit principal types---and the design of
fragile \ML extensions is all about the preservation of principal types.
However, core \ML has several other key properties:
\SetLabelAlign{mydesc}{#1:\hfill}
\begin{description}[font=\it,align=mydesc,topsep=1ex,itemsep=1ex,leftmargin=0ex]
\newcommand {\eswap}{\mathprefix  {swap}}

\item [Compositionality]
  If $\G \th \E \where \e : \t$ then there exists $\Gp$ and $\tp$ such that
  $\Gp \th \e : \tp$ and for all term $\ep$ such that $\Gp \th \ep : \tp$,
  then $\G \th \E \where \ep : \t$.

\item [Factorization]
  If $\G \th \e \where {\x \is \ez} : \t$ and $\G \th \ez : \ts$ then
  $\G \th \elet \x \ez \e : \t$.

%% \item [Inlining]
%%   If $\G \th \elet \x \ez \e : \t$ then $\G \th \e \where {\x \is \ez} : \t$

\item [Application equitypability]
  The expressions $\eappp f \ea \eb$ and $\eappp {\eswap f} \eb \ea$ are
  equitypable where $\eswap$ is $\efun f {\efun \xa {\efun \xb {\eappp f \xb
  \ea}}}$.  Thanks to a few other properties, this implies in turn that
  $\eapp f \ea$ and $\eApp f \ea$ and $\eb \ePipe \ea$ are themselves
  equi-typable where are the application function $\efun f \efun \x \eapp f
  \x$ and the reverse application function $\efun \x \efun f \eapp f \x$,
  respectively.

\end{description}
It is well-known that bidirectional types inference breaks application
equi-typability. However, both \Geninst-directional and omnidirectional type
inference preserve it.

In core \ML, Factorization is a consequence of principal types and
compositionality.  It is definitely broken by overloading, since the inlined
version may has several overloading sites that may be resolved differently.
However, we may wonder about linear factorization, \ie. when $\x$ occurs
exactly once in~$\e$.  This is again broken by bidirectional type inference,
but preserved by both \Geninst-directional and omnidirectional type inference,
although for different reasons: for \Geninst-directional type inference, it
follows from the limited use of contextual type information; for
omnidirectional type inference, it follows by backpropagation\Xdidier{I
think this is not the right term}.

\Xdidier {How formal should we be? Should we justify these claims?}

\section{Solving constraints}
\label{sec:solving}

% Intro
We now present a machine for solving constraints in our language. The solver
operates as a rewriting system on constraints $\c \csolve \cp$. Once no further
transitions are applicable, \ie $\c \cnsolve$, the constraint $\c$ is either in
solved form -- from which we can read off a most general solution -- or the
solver becomes stuck, indicating that $\c$ is unsatisfiable.

% Contexts
% Treatment of $alpha$-equivalence in contexts
% Membership of constraints

% Unification
\subsection{Unification}
%
Our constraints ultimately reduce to equations between types, which we solve
using first-order unification. Like our solver, we specify unification as a
non-deterministic rewriting relation between \emph{unification problems} $\upa
\unif \upb$.

\begin{bnffig}
  {fig:unification-syntax}
  {Syntax of unification problems}
  \entry[Unification problems]{\up}{
    \ctrue \and \cfalse \and \upa \cand \upb \and \cexists \tv \up \and \ueq
  } \\
  \entry[Multi-equations]{\ueq}{
    \eset \mid \cunif \ueq \t
  }
\end{bnffig}

% Multi-equations
Unification problems $\up$ are a restricted subset of constraints.
To enable an efficient presentation of unification, we adopt
\emph{multi-equations} \citep{Pottier-Remy/emlti}---a multi-set of types
considered equal. These generalize binary equalities and their semantic
interpretation is given by:
\begin{mathpar}
  \infer[Multi-Unif]
    {\tp \in \Ground \\
     \all {\t \in \ueq}\, \semenv(\t) = \tp}
    {\semenv \vdash \ueq}
\end{mathpar}
That is, $\semenv$ satisfies $\ueq$ if all members of $\ueq$ are mapped to a
single ground type $\tp$ by $\semenv$. We consider multi-equations equal
modulo permutation of their members.

% The spec
The unification rules are listed in \cref{fig:unification-algorithm}. Rewriting
proceeds modulo $\alpha$-equivalence, as well as associativity
and commutativity of conjuctions, and takes place under an arbitrary
unification problem context $\Up$.
%
Our algorithm is largely standard \cite{Pottier-Remy/emlti} but replaces type
constructors with \emph{canonical principal shapes}, enabling a uniform
treatment of monotypes and polytypes within unification, avoiding the need for
specialised handling of polytypes, as found in \citep{Garrigue-Remy/poly-ml}.

% Explaination of rules
We briefly summarize the purpose of each rule below: \Rule{U-Exists} lifts
existential quantifiers to the top of the unification problem, enabling
applications of \Rule{U-Merge} and \Rule{U-Cycle} as all multi-equations
eventually part of a single conjunction. \Rule{U-Merge} combines
mutli-equations sharing a common variable. \Rule{U-Stutter} removes duplicate
occurrences of a variable. \Rule{U-Decomp} decomposes equal types with matching
shapes into equalities between their subcomponents. \Rule{U-Clash} complements
\Rule{U-Decomp}, handling shape mistmatches that result in failure.
\Rule{U-Name} introduces a fresh variable to expose a subcomponent of a shape,
ensuring unification over \emph{shallow terms}, making sharing of type
variables explicit and avoids the need for copying types in rules such as
\Rule{U-Decomp}. \Rule{U-True} and \Rule{U-Trivial} eliminate trivial
constraints. The latter occurs when a multi-equation $\ueq$ is trivial, that
is, when it is either empty ($\eset$) or contains only a single type ($\cunif
\t \eset$).

\Rule{U-Cycle} implements the \emph{occurs check}, ensuring that a type
variable does not occur in the type it is being unified with. This is a
necessary condition for unification, as it would otherwise lead to infinite
types\footnote{We discuss relaxing this constraint in ??}. Cyclicity
is defined by the relation $\tv \prec_\up \tvb$ indicating that $\tv$ occurs
in a type assigned to $\tvb$ in $\up$. A unification problem is cyclic,

% Solved forms
A unification problem is in \emph{solved form} if it has the structure
\begin{mathpar}
  \cexists \tvs \cAnd \iton \ueqi
\end{mathpar}
where each $\ueqi$ contains at most one non-variable type, variables
do not occur in multiple equations, and the problem is acyclic. From
such a form, a most general unifier $\vartheta$ can be directly read off.


\subsection{Solving rules}
%\paragraph{Solving rules}
%
%We now introduce the rules of the constraint solver itself
%(\cref{fig:omni-solver}). These rules are non-deterministic. Rewriting is
%performed modulo $\alpha$-equivalence, commutativity and assoiciativity of
%conjuction and under an arbitrary \emph{constraint context} $\Cctx$.
%
%
%\begin{mathparfig}
%  {fig:omni-solver}
%  {Select rewriting rules of the solver}
%
%  \rewrite[S-Unif]
%    {\Cctx[\Ua] \\ \Ua \longrightarrow \Ub}
%    {\Cctx[\Ub]}
%
%  \rewrite[S-True]
%    {\C \Cand \Ctrue}
%    {\C}
%
%  \rewrite[S-Exists-Conj]
%    {(\Cexists \alpha \Ca) \Cand \Cb \\ \tv \disjoint \Cb}
%    {\Cexists \tv {\Ca \Cand \Cb}}
%
%  \rewrite[S-Exists-Let]
%    {\Cletlam \x \tv \Ca {\Cexists \tvb \Cb} \\ \tvb \disjoint \tv, \Ca}
%    {\Cexists \tvb {\Cletlam \x \tv \Ca \Cb}}
%
%  \rewrite[S-Lift-Let2]

%    {\Cc \Cand \Cletlam \x \tv \Ca \Cb}

%    {\Clet \x {\Clam \tvas {\Ca \Cand \Cb}} \Cc \\ \tvas \disjoint \Ca}
%    {\Ca \Cand \Clet \x {\Clam \tvas \Cb} \Cc}
%\end{mathparfig}
%
%% Common rule descriptions
%\paragraph{Basic rules} \Rule{S-Unif} invokes the unification algorithm to the
%current unification problem. The unification algorithm itself is treated as a
%block box by the solver, allowing the slover to be parameterized over the
%equational theory of types implemented by the unifier.
%%
%\Rule{S-Exists-Lift*} lifts existential quantifiers to the nearest enclosing
%$\Let$, if any, or otherwise to the top of the constraint, which
%we refer to as a \emph{region} within the constraint.
%Similarly, \Rule{S-Lift-Let*} hoists constraints out of let-binders
%when they do not depend on the locally bound variables. These lifting rules
%normalize the structure of each region into a block of existentially bound
%variables with a unification problem, together with unresolved constraints.
%
%\paragraph{Suspended constraints}
%
%\Rule{S-Susp-Use} solves suspended match constraints whose scruintee
%has a locally known shape -- either statically, or as a result of appplying
%\Rule{S-Susp-Ctx}. The rule selects a unique matching branch based on the shape
%of the scruitinee and applies the generated substitution to the branch. If no
%branch matches, the rule is stuck, indicating that the constraint is
%unsatisfiable.
%
%\begin{mathparfig}
%  {fig:omin-solver-susp}
%  {Solving rules for suspended match constraints.}
%  \rewrite[S-Susp-Ctx]
%    {\Cctx[\Cmatchp \tv \shcases]\\
%     \shape(\t) = \shq \tvcs \tp \\
%     \tv \Ceq \t \Ceq \Ueq \in \Cctx}
%    {\Cctx[\Cexists \tvcs  \tv \Ceq \tp \Cand \Cmatchp \tp \shcases]}
%
%  \rewrite[S-Susp-Use]
%    {\Cmatchp \t {\Ccase {\bar \shpat} {\bar \C}} \\
%     \shape(\t) \downarrow \\
%     \shpati \matches \shape(\t) \leadsto \theta}
%    {\theta(\Ci)}
%\end{mathparfig}
%
%When the solver encounters a suspended constraint with an unknown shape, it
%cannot proceed immediately. Instead, it must wait until it can construct
%a surrounding context $\Cctx$ that includes a multi-equation unifying the
%scruintee with a type whose shape is defined. This enables the suspended
%match to be rewritten, according to \Rule{Sat-Susp-Ctx}, thereby exposing
%the shape required to continue solving in \Rule{S-Susp-Use}.
%
%\paragraph{Let constraints}
%% Let-constraint solving is generalization
%Application constraints can be solved by copying constraints
%(\ie $\beta$-reduction):
%\begin{mathpar}
%  \rewrite[S-Let-App-Copy]
%    {\Cletlam \x \tv \Ca {\Cctx[\Capp \x \t]} \\ \tv \disjoint \t}
%    {\Cletlam \x \tv \Ca {\Cctx[\Cexists \tv \tv \Ceq \t \Cand \Ca]}}
%\end{mathpar}
%However, this duplicates constraint solving work. A more efficient
%strategy first solves the abstraction fully and then reuses it --
%solving constraint abstractions is equivalent to rank-based generalization
%\cite{book/atapl/Pottier04}.
%
%% Generalization with suspended constraints is hard
%But, the inclusion of suspended constraints complicates generalization.
%To illustrate this, let us examine:
%%
%\begin{program}[input]
%  type three = { x : int; y : int } (* y is overloaded *)
%  ...
%  let e_9 r = let y = r.y in r.x + y
%\end{program}
%The generated constraint\footnote{Simplified for readability.} is:
%\begin{mathpar}
%  \Cexists \tv
%    \Clet y {\Clam \tvb {\Cmatchp \tva {\parens
%      {\Ccase {\wild \Tapp[t]}
%	      {\Omega(y/t) \leq \tvb \Tarr \tva}}}}}
%      \Capp y \mathsf{int} \Cand \tv \Ceq {\mathsf{three}}
%\end{mathpar}
%Here, $\tv$ is \code{r}'s type. The constraint remains
%suspended until \code{r.x} forces \code{r}'s type to be \code{three}
%When generalizing \code{y}, the type $\tvb$ -- captured by the match --
%has not yet been resolved. We must, however, allocate a scheme for \code{y},
%resulting in $\Tforall \tvb \tvb$ -- which appears unsound since $\tvb$ later
%unifies with $\Tint$.
%
%% Partial schemes are the solution
%This motivates \emph{partial type schemes}: type schemes that delay commitment
%to certain quantifications (\eg $\tvb$). These \emph{partially generalized}
%variables are generalized, but can still be refined in future as suspended
%constraints are discharged.
%
%% Partial instantiation syntax
%To encode partial schemes, we introduce \emph{partial application constraints}
%$\Cpapp \x \theta \U$, where $\theta$ maps variables bound inside $\x$'s
%abstraction to fresh copies and $\U$ accumulates copied multi-equations.
%Copying proceeds by two rules:
%
%\begin{enumerate}
%  \item \Rule{S-Papp-Exists} allocates fresh existential variables at the call
%    site that are mapped to uninstantiated variables within the abstraction.
%    We write $\theta : \tvs$ for $\dom(\theta) = \tvs$.
%
%  \item \Rule{S-Papp-Unif} copies multi-equations from the abstraction
%    to the call site.
%\end{enumerate}
%
%\begin{mathparfig}
%  {fig:omni-solver-schemes}
%  {Solving rules for let-bindings and applications.}
%  \rewrite[S-Let-App]
%    {\Cletlam \x \tv \Ca \Cctx[\Capp \x \t]}
%    {\Cletlam \x \tv \Ca \Cctx[\Cexists \tvb
%      \Cpapp \x {\where {\tv \assign \tvb}} {\Ctrue} ]}
%
%  \rewrite[S-Papp-Exists]
%    {\Clet \x {\Clam \tvs \Cexists \tvb \Ca} \Cctx[\Cpapp \x \theta \U] \\
%     \theta : \tvs}
%    {\Clet \x {\Clam {\tvs, \tvb} \Ca}
%      \Cctx[\Cexists \tvbp \Cpapp \x {\theta, \tvb \assign \tvbp} \U]}
%

%     \theta : \tvs}
%    {\Clet \x {\Clam \tvs \Ca \Cand \hat{\Ueq}}
%      \Cctx[\Cpapp \x \theta {\U \Cand \hat{\Ueq}} \Cand \theta(\hat{\Ueq})]}
%
%  \rewrite[S-Papp-Solve]
%    {\Clet \x {\Clam \tvs \Up} {\Cctx[\Cpapp \x \theta \U]} \\
%     \theta : \tvs \\
%     U \vDash \Up}
%    {\Clet \x {\Clam \tvs \Up} {\Cctx[\Ctrue]}}
%
%  \rewrite[S-Let-Solve]
%    {\Clet \x {\Clam \tv \U} \C \\ \x \disjoint \C \\
%     \Cexists \tv \U \equiv \Ctrue}
%    {\Cb}
%
%  \rewrite[S-Lower]
%    {\Clet \x {\Clam {\tvas, \tvbs} \Ca}
%      {\Cctx[\overline{\Cpapp \x \theta \U}]} \\
%     \Cexists {\tvas} \Ca \text{ determines } \tvbs \\
%     \theta : \tvas, \tvbs}
%    {\Cexists \tvbs
%      \Clet \x {\Clam \tvas \Ca}
%	{\Cctx[{\overline{\Cpapp \x {\theta \setminus \tvbs} \U
%			 \Cand \theta(\tvbs) = \tvbs}}]}}
%  \\
%\end{mathparfig}
%
%% Cleaning up partial applications and let constraints
%\Rule{S-Papp-Solve} removes partial applications once all necessary constraints
%have been copied -- that is, when the copied equations entail the abstraction
%body. \Rule{S-Let-Solve} remove a $\Let$ constraint when the bound term variable
%is unused and the abstraction is satisfiable.
%
%\Rule{S-Lower} implements R\'emy's efficient rank-based generalization:
%variables $\tvbs$ dominated by monomorphic variables are removed from the
%abstraction. Partial applications that copied $\tvbs$ are notified, unifying
%their copies with the lowered $\tvbs$.
%
%\paragraph{Backpropagation}
%Our semantics supports \emph{backpropagation}, allowing type information
%from use sites to refine matched variables inside generalised abstractions.
%
%For example, in:
%\begin{program}[input]
%  let e$_{10}$ = let f r = r.y in f ({ x = 1; y = 1 })
%\end{program}
%\OCaml rejects this, as \Pidirectional inference cannot propagate the known
%type \code{three} back to \code{f}'s parameter.
%The (simplified) constraint generated when typing \code{e}$_{10}$ is:
%\begin{align*}
%  \Cexists \tv
%  &\Let f = \Clam \delta {\Cexists {\tvb, \tvc}
%    \delta \Ceq {\tvb \Tarr \tvc}
%    \Cand \Cmatchp \tvb {(\Ccase {\wild \Tapp[t]} {\Omega(y / t) \leq \gamma \Tarr \beta})}} \\
%  &\hspace{-1mm}\In \Capp f {(\mathsf{three} \to \tv)}
%\end{align*}
%At the use site, the abstraction is applied with a type of known shape (\code{three}).
%\Rule{S-BackProp} propagates this shape back into the suspendede match inside the
%abstraction by unifying it with the variable $\tvb$. This is sound: the unicity
%predicate $\Cshape \Cctx \tv \sh$ ensures that $\tvb$'s shape is \code{three}
%provided the context $\Cctx$ include the application constraint.
%\begin{mathpar}
%  \rewrite[S-BackProp]
%    {\Cctx[\Cletlam \x \tvs {\Cctxa[\Cmatchp \tv \shcases]} {\Cctxb[x[\theta \tack U]]}] \\
%     \theta : \tvs \\
%     \theta(\alpha) \Ceq \t \Ceq \Ueq \in \Cctx, \Cctxb \\
%     \shape(\t) = \shq \tvcs \tp}
%    {\Cctx[\Cletlam \x \tvs {\Cctxa[\Cexists \tvcs \tv = \tp \Cand \Cmatchp \tp \shcases]} {\Cctxb[x[\theta \tack U]]}]}
%\end{mathpar}
%

\paragraph{Interaction with let-polymorphism}
\Xgabriel{This was moved from the introduction, it's related to ``choice points'' below.}

%% Our intuition is not entirely correct here.

While the above constraint generation already improves on
OCaml's current inference approach, it is not powerful enough to capture the
simple idea that to resolve an ambiguous constructor we must use contextual
information to show there is a unique type constructor $\F$ for the
application.

We demonstrate this is with the following example:
\begin{program}
let foo =
  let f x = match x with L -> 1 in
  f (L : m)
\end{program}
With the above contraint generation, we would keep the type of \code{x}
as a generalizable variable, thus the application of \code{f} would not
resolve this ambiguity, requiring an annotation at the definition.

We require some way of splitting the head of the type from the type itself,
treating the head of the variable monomorphically and the rest
polymorphically.
\Xalistair{An explaination of kinded(1) types here }

\subsection{Choice points}

\Xdidier {Is this subsection obsolete?}
\begin{version}{}
The current typing rules don't support back-propagation:
\begin{program}
fun (r1 : one) -> let g r = r.x in g r1
\end{program}
\end{version}


\subsection{Default rules}

Type inference may failed either because of a typing error (the constraint
if of the form $\C \where \cfalse$), or because some choice point cannot be
resolved---a stuck constraint containt a suspended match constraint.
%
In the later case, we may point the user to at least one choice point that
could not be solved and invite him to provide additional type annotations.

In fact \OCaml uses default rules in case overloaded contructors or record
field have not been solved, then selecting the most recently defined type.

While, we could also introduce similar default rules in our proposal, they
would break the properties of the type system.  Hence, instead of
integrating default rules in omnidirectional type inference, we prefer to
see them as an additional external mechanism that suggests extra type
annotations in case of failture and calls back type inference, which may
resume from its previous state.

Still, we discuss reasonable choice for defauls.

\paragraph{Structural tuples}

\paragraph{Polytypes}


\subsection{Recursive types}
\label {sec/rec-types}

For sake of simplicity, we have taken finite trees for ground types, that
is, for the semantics of constraints. However, replacing trees by regular
trees for ground types would preserver the metatheoretical properties, as
in~\cite {Pottier-Remy/emlti}, as we never assume finiteness of ground
types.  This would allow type inference with equirecursive types.

Technically, we need to extend the syntax of types with
\begin{mathpar}
\begin{bnfgrammar}
\entry {\t}{\ldots \mid \trec \tv \t}
\end{bnfgrammar}
\end{mathpar}
The only technical difficult lies in the definition of shapes.  We must
ensure the existence of a miniaml element for recursive types $\trec \tv
\t$, including in the presentce of polytypes.  This can be ensured using the
canonical representation proposed by~\cite
{Gauthier-Pottier/numbering@icfp04}.
\Xdidier {How much more should we say?}



\section{Semi-unification Prototype}

Rank-2 polymorphic type inference with semi-unification!

\Xdidier{When you do rank-2 unification, you don't need a 'let' anymore
because 'lambda' is enough. You have rank-2 types but you cannot bind
them. It's not as exciting as I thought it would be.}

\section{Related work}
\label{sec:related-work}

Should we cite \cite{Leijen-Ye/prefix@pldi2025} ?

\subsection{Qualified types}

\Xdidier {The following paragaph is just take from the old introduction}

Qualified types~\citep*{TODO} represent additional knowledge on a type. They
are used in particular in Haskell type-classes, where a constraint
$\mathsf{Show}~\alpha$ represents the fact that a part of the inferred term
needs to print values of type $\alpha$. A constraint on a ground type such
as $\mathsf{Show}~\mathsf{Int}$ can be resolved to a known printer. But if
the undetermined variable $\alpha$ becomes generalizable in a type $\tau$,
we get a type-scheme $\tfor{(\alpha \mid \mathsf{Show}~\alpha)}{\tau}$ that
also includes the type-class constraint.

DRAFT: Type-classes let each use-site choose a different typeclass instance
-- but this implies dictionary-passing or specialization. Sometimes we want
the choice to be shared by all use-sites:


\subsection{Suspended constraints in \textsc{OutsideIn}}

\Xalistair{They first solve simple constraints (existentials,
unification). Then they solve ``... constraints'', with implication
constraints, which corresponds to the case of GADT matches. Crucially, they
abandon local let generalization.}

\subsection{Suspended constraints in dependent-type systems}


\subsection{Bi-directional type inference}

\Xgabriel{Our approach should have better properties for disambiguation, but
which ones?}

In the simply-typed case our system works better. But with generalization
you can have more issues.

\Xdidier{Should we try to extend what we did to predicative polymorphism?}

\Xalistair{Not ready yet and would probably need too much space.}

\Xgabriel{CoreML + bidirectional disambiguation of constructors?}

\TODO
{do we understand what to say precisely about bidirectional type inference?}

\subsection{Principality tracking in \OCaml}

\Xdidier{The point of that is to enforce a directional type inference that
is based on let-bindings. When we check that the level is generic, we check
that we already ``closed'' this thing, it is an earlier 'let'
binding. Because we are omni-directional, we don't have principality issues
anymore -- except with default rules. We are principal by construction, we
never make any choice.}

\Xdidier{Principality tracking is making the choice that we are going to
make a directional let-binding-based type inference. We get rid of that, we
are omni-directional, and don't have any principality issues.}

\Xgabriel{We should not claim too much if we don't understand default
clauses well enough. It could people the impression that we hide the issue
under the carpet.}

\Xdidier{First a declarative/principal system, and then non-principal
heuristics to refine it, a two-phase process. It's fine.}
